									<h1><strong>Finding a Mentor<strong></h1>
									<h2 class="colorlib-heading">Networking  |  September 13, 2021</h2>
									<h3>By: Grace Kane</h3>
									<h4>It is never too early or too late in your career to find a mentor. Flight training is arduous and there are numerous highs and lows that accompany the journey of student to professional pilot. Mentors can serve a crucial role in encouragement, exposure, and advancement in one's future. I can attest that I would not be where I am if it weren't for my mentors offering constant support and pushing me towards my next goals.</h4>

									<h4>A mentorship can take the form of a formal or informal relationship. My aunt and cousin were my first mentors as I began my private pilot training. They provided me the resources to succeed and persevere when training became tedious and difficult. Furthermore, my older siblings served as an immense mentors for me. I witnessed them become leaders of their craft, giving back to others and impacting their communities in amazing ways and I was inspired to do the same. As a result of this mentorship from my family early on, I have high aspirations to serve as a mentor in my future for kids who don't come from an aviation family or may not have anyone to look to for support in their life. </h4>

									<h4>When I arrived in St. Louis for my freshman year, I realized I was far from face-to-face family support and therefore, I sought a mentor in the area. I stumbled upon Women in Corporate Aviation, unbeknownst at the time that I was destined for a career in corporate aviation. I was paired with a mentor who flew a Gulfstream 500 and 600 in St. Louis similar to this aircraft currently on the market with <a href="https://www.globalair.com/aircraft-for-sale/ListingDetail/Gulfstream-G550?AdId=89878Global">Global Air.</a> At the time, I had only my private pilot license and my mentor  powered up the aircraft for me and spent an hour in the plane explaining the aircraft and its systems to me. Although our formal mentorship ended after a year, she continues to serve as a foundation of support and she has connected me to numerous individuals in the industry who I also often look to for encouragement. </h4>

									<h4>If you are lost on how to go about finding a mentor, I have some helpful tips that could lead to you gaining a lifelong mentor. </h4>
									<li><h4>Look into professional organization mentorship programs Some examples include Women in Corporate Aviation, Women in Aviation, National Business Aviation Association, Airline Pilots Association, etc. The National Business Aviation Association is assigning mentors to mentees from now until September 30th. You can make a profile and choose an industry professional to serve as your mentor. All of the listed mentors have a long list of impressive accomplishments and can be a great source of networking as well as learning leadership skills that you can transfer into your everyday life.

									<li><h4>Connect with professionals on LinkedIn.I recently spoke to a friend wanting to greater expose himself to corporate aviation. He found pilots at Fortune 500 companies and connected with them on LinkedIn and sent a message to them requesting to form a mentorship. He has had numerous phone calls with some of them and has successfully gained mentors that way.</h4></li>
									<li><h4>A mentor doesn't have to be in the same career field as you. During my internship this past summer, I gained great perspectives from company employees who were engineers and business people. As a young professional, I believe these perspectives helped me develop and advance myself on another level. Mentorships both within your industry and outside of your industry help contribute to a well-rounded professional who is able to adapt to a range of environments and personalities.</h4></li>

									<h4>If you are just beginning your training or education and are looking for advice from someone who recently went through those stages, I have extensive knowledge I can share with you. Please don't hesitate to reach out for support. Aviation is a tight-knit community and I have never met anyone who wasn't willing to help me advance myself in the industry, so I am happy to do my part in giving back to this amazing community.</h4>

									<h4>This weeks post is in remembrance of my cousin and mentor, Andrew St. Denis. Andrew was 26 and passed away a few days ago in a car accident. He was just nearing his check ride to become an Airline Transport Pilot for Republic Airways and he had a successful career ahead of him in commercial aviation. Throughout my flight training and life he served as a huge mentor to me and he was a pilot I aspired to mimic in my future. It was his mom, a medevac pilot, who gave me the motivation to enter aviation and Andrew helped propel me even further in it. I know he will always be there with me when I take to the skies. The future of aviation lost one of its best, but I know Andrew's legacy in the skies will be well carried by all those who he touched. Fly high, Andrew, and blue skies and tailwinds up there. </h4>

									<h1><strong>Industry Experiences Early On<strong></h1>
									<h2 class="colorlib-heading">Professional Development  |  September 6, 2021</h2>

									<h4>Whether you're a student or industry professional, the value of internships on one's future can not be understated. For the industry professionals, if you don't already have an internship program established, I highly recommend bringing the idea to fruition. For the students, you will not regret obtaining an internship for a summer or semester during your college years. I always tell my peers that flight training and classes can be done at any time, but the opportunity to get real industry experience and work alongside distinguished professionals early on in your career journey is rare.</h4>

									<h4>Following my freshman year at SLU, I caught a glimpse of Part 135 and 91 operations through an internship with Pentastar Aviation in Waterford, Michigan. Although it was not a typical internship experience due to COVID, it was so valuable to gain hands-on experience in the Operations Control Center at Pentastar while most of the country worked from home. As a Flight Follower Intern, I was tasked with the behind the scenes jobs such as ensuring catering was ordered and delivered, tracking weather and flights, building trips, and more. While I was not necessarily around the aircraft, I gained a solid understanding of all the factors that contribute to safe and efficient operations and as a future corporate pilot, I will forever have an appreciation for the people behind desks arranging the details to get me airborne. This opportunity provided me the chance to get my feet wet in business aviation and also solidified my decision to focus my career on corporate aviation, which resulted in me pursuing an internship with a corporate flight department the following summer.
									<h4><h4>

									<h4>I would have never imagined a year ago that I would have the experiences I had this past summer. I worked as a Pilot Intern for a Fortune 250 company from May to August and during this time, I was exposed to all the facets of a corporate flight department. I not only sat in the jump seat on trips in an aircraft very similar to <a href="https://www.globalair.com/aircraft-for-sale/ListingDetail/Challenger-350?AdId=93006">this one Global Air has for sale</a>, but I also got to witness maintenance inspections and spend time with the scheduler. In addition, I attended Upset Prevention and Recovery Training with Prevailance Aerospace, flew a Challenger 350 simulator at Flight Safety, and connected with a handful of pilots while on trips. These experiences were unmatched and because of it, I will be much more prepared to enter the industry once I graduate. Most importantly, I learned what it means to be apart of a strong company culture that embodies a family-like atmosphere and I gained lifelong mentors in the people I worked with.

									<h4>Since I am graduating this May and hopefully moving onto a flight instructor position, my summers spent as an intern have come to an end. However, I am a huge proponent for internships and helping my peers excel, so if I can offer any tips in obtaining an internship or answer any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.</h4>

  								<h1><strong>From Bedtime Stories to Commercial Pilot<strong></h1>
                  <h2 class="colorlib-heading">About Me  |  August 30, 2021</h2>
                  <h3>By: Grace Kane</h3>
                  <img src="images/Alden.JPG" width="300" height="400" align="left" /><h4></h4><h4>Typically the first thing talked about when meeting someone new in aviation is "what got you into aviation?" Aviation is a unique field because everyone has a story behind who or what moment sparked their interest in it.<h4>
                  <h4>Like some aviators, the affinity for the skies runs in my family. My grandfather, Alden Kane, flew the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress in WWII and instilled a love for flying early on in my dad and his siblings. My bedtime stories as a child mostly consisted of me questioning my dad about his adventures flying with my grandfather, my grandmother, and my aunts and uncles in their family aircraft. Although those stories evidence my interest in aviation from an early age, I was not one of those kids that grew up knowing I wanted to be a pilot and unfortunately, my parents never dressed me as a pilot for Halloween (but that would have made for cool pictures today).<p>
                  <h4>So how does that bring me to where I am now? As a sophomore in high school, I was considering career options and I wanted to choose a field that was meaningful, impactful, and rewarding. At the same time, my aunt was re-entering the corporate aviation industry as a pilot after a hiatus. My aunt was all the motivation and encouragement I needed in my destined quest to become a professional pilot.<h4>
                  <h4>Shortly after the spark to become a pilot ignited, I took a discovery flight at Oakland County International Airport (PTK), which is close to my hometown of West Bloomfield, Michigan and I was hooked. From that day forward, I decided there was no other way I could fulfill my future than in aviation. I soloed at age 16 and got my private pilot license just a month into my senior year of high school before I was faced with the daunting decision of choosing a college.<h4>
                  <h4>I originally gravitated towards larger aviation universities for their stellar rankings and industry connections. However, close to the time when my decision needed to be made, I realized I may get lost in the numbers, afraid to find my voice and build meaningful relationships. I switched up my deposits in a matter of seconds and enrolled at Saint Louis University - Parks College, where I am currently entering my senior year. Fun fact: Parks College is America's first federally certified school of aviation and our flight school certificate reads No. 1. The 150 students and 20 flight instructors in the flight program embodies a family-like atmosphere, where I can recognize almost every student and I can easily approach any instructor to fly with me for an out-of-block flight.<h4>
                  <img src="images/Blog.jpg" width="400" height="600" align="right" /><h4></h4><h4>This past June, I received my commercial pilot certificate for single-engine aircraft and I am training for my multi-engine add-on now. I also had an amazing internship experience in corporate aviation in Cleveland that solidified my desire to want to fly for a Fortune 500 company in my future. Being a senior now feels quite bittersweet, but I am looking forward to seeing myself grow and gain new perspectives in my relationships with my peers, instructors, and mentors. It is so meaningful to me to be able to carry on the Kane legacy in the skies knowing that my grandfather is smiling from above.<h4>
                  <h4>I am excited to share my experiences through my weekly blog, so be on the lookout every Monday for a new post. A huge thank you to <a href="www.globalair.com">Global Air</a> for awarding me the Calvin L. Carrithers scholarship and for supporting my aviation journey. Whether you're looking for a single-engine, private jet, or helicopter - look no further than <a href="www.globalair.com">Global Air</a> for your aircraft purchase. </h4>

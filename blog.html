									<h1><strong>Parks College Diversity, Equality, & Inclusion Event<strong></h1>
									<h2 class="colorlib-heading">Diversity in Aviation |  April 1, 2022</h2>
									<h4></h4>
									<h4>As we know, aviation is a traditionally underrepresented field by females and minorities. It is those who have come before minority individuals that show them that they can achieve their dreams in aviation. </h4>

									<h4>My education at Saint Louis University has given me the opportunity to have valuable and necessary conversations about diversity, equality, and inclusion with my peers who come from all different backgrounds. These conversations have enabled me to gain perspectives from various people. Diversity in aviation is so crucial to producing high performing teams because people of different backgrounds and experiences can spark creativity and innovation. </h4>
									<img src="images/IMG_2334.jpg" width="500" height="700" align="left" /><h4>
									<h4>Parks College has a team of individuals dedicated to promoting Diversity, Equality, and Inclusion (DE&I) across our college. The team recently hosted Gigi Coleman, the grandniece of the first African-American pilot Bessie Coleman, for a speaker event so students could learn the story of Bessie Coleman's life. </h4>

									<h4>Through Gigi Coleman's reenactment of Bessie's life, where she assumed the character of Bessie, I learned that Bessie was told she couldn't get her pilots license in the United States because of the color of her skin and her gender. Bessie's plight to see herself in the skies forced her to want to move to France where females were able to fly. However, Bessie encountered a barrier as she did not know how to speak French, so she spent nights studying French so she could submit her flight school application. </h4>

									<h4>On June 15, 1921, Bessie Coleman received her pilots license and set out on her dream to own a flight school. She returned to the United States and began giving flight lessons, performing in flight shows, and encouraging African Americans and women to learn how to fly. Unfortunately, Bessie perished in a plane crash after a loose wrench got stuck in the engine of the aircraft she was piloting. </h4>

									<h4>Bessie Coleman is well remembered across the aviation community for her trailblazing efforts for females and African Americans in aviation. Although Bessie's dream to open a flight school and instruct African American's did not happen, she impacted many and she is a model of eminence in the skies today. Gigi Coleman started a non-profit aviation program in Bessie's honor in 2013 called The Bessie Coleman Aviation All-Stars (BCAA). The program aims to expose disadvantaged youth to career opportunities in the field of aviation and it is located in Chicago. </h4>

									<h4>All in all, Mrs. Coleman's speech was extremely empowering and I was grateful to be joined by my 13 year-old mentee, Journey (pictured above with me and Gigi Coleman), who has aspirations of being a pilot. May we all look to those who came ahead of us for motivation, support those who are on the journey beside us, and mentor those behind us who are coming up the ranks in order to promote a diverse industry and help others achieve their dreams!</h4>
									<h1><strong>2022 Women in Aviation Conference<strong></h1>
									<h2 class="colorlib-heading">Professional Development |  March 25, 2022</h2>
									<h4></h4>
									<h4>Wow, what an amazing conference Women in Aviation International put together following 2021's virtual conference! It was so refreshing to be in a setting filled with so much energy and enthusiasm for the future of aviation.  </h4>

									<h4>I am grateful Parks College supported myself and nine other students to attend this years conference. As the former president of our WAI Chapter, it was my goal to send the largest group ever to the conference and we accomplished it. For most in our group, it was their first time at the conference. I had attended previously in 2020, so I knew some tips for utilizing my time while at the conference. Prior to the conference, I laid out all the exhibitors I wanted to talk to and all the education sessions I was planning to attend. </h4>
									<img src="images/WAI3.jpeg" width="500" height="700" align="right" /><h4>
									<h4>It was an action packed and productive three days. Some of the highlights included: </h4>
									<h4>- Representing Parks College at our exhibitor booth: I have truly enjoyed my experience at Parks College, so I love that sharing with prospective students and answering their questions. We also had many alumni stop by our booth and it was fun to connect with them and share our stories. One thing I like about Parks is that our faculty turnover is low, so even people that graduated 10 or 20 years had the same professors I do now. </h4>
									<h4>- Working the Women in Corporate Aviation Booth: As I turn over my commitments at Parks College, I have been seeking new organizations to volunteer with. I have been a member of WCA since my freshman year and they have provided me an amazing mentor, circle of support, and an educational scholarship. It was rewarding to be able to share my experience as a member with prospective members, so that they can also benefit from the resources WCA offers. I look forward to my future as a WCA member and I hope to assume a greater volunteer role.</h4>
									<h4>- General Session on Friday: The Keynote speakers included Sheila Remes - VP of Environmental Sustainability at Boeing, Niloofar Rahmani - first female pilot for the Afghan Air Force, and General Jacqueline D. Van Ovost - U.S. commander of U.S. Transportation Command. It was inspiring to hear these powerful women speak and share their advice for overcoming challenges in the industry. </h4>
									<h4>- Attending the WCA social and Careers in Business Aviation Panel: At both of these events, I got to meet females in aviation who I have looked up to for quite some time through social media - one of them flies a <a href="https://www.globalair.com/aircraft-for-sale/ListingDetail/Gulfstream-G600?AdId=124396">G550/G600 like this one</a> and that is my dream plane to fly. It was empowering to make connections within my desired field of business aviation and speak with females for have paved the way for the younger generation to succeed in the field. </h4>

									<h4>Most of all, I enjoyed reconnecting with people I had met two years ago at conference. It is continually building on these relationships that makes this industry so special. This year, I most looked forward to seeing my mentor who is a FedEx pilot. She went to the same all girls high school as me in Michigan and we connected my senior year of high school when she found out I wanted to be a pilot. We don't live in the same state, so the past two conferences have provided us an excellent opportunity to reconnect. I am excited to attend the conference in the future and carry on the relationships I have built!</h4>

									<h1><strong>Collegiate Aviation Programs vs. Accelerated Programs<strong></h1>
									<h2 class="colorlib-heading">Flight Training |  March 11, 2022</h2>
									<h4></h4>
										<h4>This past week, I finished the last round of midterms of my college career. Time has really flown by and I have recently been reflecting on my experience at Saint Louis University quite a bit. I am grateful to have chosen the collegiate path because it has allowed me to obtain a well-rounded education, grow my network, and be presented with opportunities I wouldn't have had elsewhere. However, there is a right path for everyone in pursuing a career as a pilot, so I hope to compare my experience at SLU to accelerated programs such as United Aviate or ATP. </h4>

										<h4>The first thing that stands out as a difference between these programs is the time of completion. Accelerated programs are well-known for getting students through all their ratings from private to MEI in anywhere from a year to two years. On the other hand, a traditional collegiate aviation program is four years with classes and training intermixed. With some collegiate aviation programs, students can face delays in flight training due to a lack of aircraft or flight instructors which can prolong their time in the program. Thankfully for me, this wasn't the case as the faculty at SLU was transparent about the program throughout my decision making process. At accelerated programs, students can be forced into check rides when they are not necessarily prepared in order to stay on track of the program. Regardless of where you choose to attend it is important to speak to both the flight school administration and current students to hear their feedback. There are things that administration might not uncover to a prospective student that current students are more open to discussing.</h4>

										<h4>Another important aspect of making a flight training decision is your age and education level. Many people decide after they get a college degree that they want to pursue a career as a pilot. In this case, it would make more sense to go to an accelerated program than enroll in another bachelor's degree. As a result of the looming pilot shortage, Delta Airlines recently announced they would drop their college degree requirement. Traditionally, all the legacy carriers required a college degree, but I think in the coming months the industry will see other airlines sway from this requirement. When making a decision to pursue solely flight training or combine flight training and a college degree program, it is crucial to consider your end goal as well as having a backup plan in the event of loss of medical. As for corporate flight departments, a vast majority of operators require a college degree. </h4>
										<img src="images/N476PC.jpg" width="700" height="500" align="left"<h4>
										<h4>Flight training is not inexpensive, so program cost is an important factor to consider when making a decision. I was recently talking with a friend who is pursuing flight training at a Part 61 flight school and we made the realization that most aviation scholarships come with the requirement that you attend a degree program in aviation. This has worked in my favor in terms of eliminating costs to my college education, but for those who aren't getting an aviation degree it can be difficult to find scholarship support in funding training. This isn't to say that there aren't any scholarships out there for Part 61 students as she ended up getting awarded a few, but the scholarship opportunities are more plentiful for collegiate aviation students. On that note, <a href ="">the GlobalAir Calvin L. Carrithers Scholarship Application</a> is now open and it requires you be enrolled in a collegiate aviation program. It is a great opportunity to help fund flight training while sharing your experiences with the aviation community. </h4>

										<h4>Attending a collegiate aviation program bridged me to internship and networking opportunities in the industry that have helped propel me forward. I have had the opportunity to network with airline, cargo, and corporate pilots and I have had varied internship experiences in business aviation and aeronautical data analysis. These experiences have allowed me to develop the technical and soft skills necessary to be a successful corporate pilot. I also know that accelerated programs are well-connected with airline pathway programs. However, it can be difficult for students to take time away from these programs for an internship. In my opinion, nothing replaces real-world experiences early-on in one's career. I gained knowledge and experiences that I will carry with me into my career. Furthermore, those experiences have allowed me to nearly quadruple my network.  </h4>

										<h4>Lastly, most collegiate aviation programs are approved for a Restricted Airline Transport Pilot (R-ATP) license. This means that graduates of these programs can take their ATP exam at 1,000 flight hours versus the 1,500 hour requirement for Part 61 students. For some, this is only half a year of flight instructing, but the delay can greatly impact one's seniority at the airlines. Initially, this was a factor that heavily impacted my decision to attend a 141 program since my career aspirations were geared towards the airlines, but it doesn't matter now that I wish to have a career in business aviation.</h4>

										<h4>Although this isn't a comprehensive review of both programs, I hope to have touched on the main considerations when making an educational decision. Regardless of what type of program you choose to attend, you will receive a high quality of education and be prepared to enter the industry upon completion. Like I mentioned previously, it can be helpful to speak to a current student at the program you're looking at, so let me know if you have any questions about my experience at Saint Louis University. </h4>


									<h1><strong>A Few Realizations I Made in College<strong></h1>
									<h2 class="colorlib-heading">Flight Training |  March 4, 2022</h2>
									<h4></h4>
									<h4>My college experience has provided me insight on things I did not know prior to my education at SLU and as a result of my experiences, I have grown immensely as a person and professional. Herein, I will discuss on a few aspects to attending a Part 141 collegiate aviation program that I learned along my way. </h4>

									<h4>1. Seek a support system. </h4>
									<h4>A few days ago, a flight instructor of mine made an important point while we were discussing the fundamentals of instruction. The fundamentals of instruction is a required part of CFI training where the CFI candidate is taught the theories of learning and teaching methods so they can be flexible and adaptable to a range of students to effectively transfer their knowledge. During this lesson, we were discussing the importance of making a private pilot student feel comfortable in the environment and he brought up the fact that freshman students begin a collegiate flight training program away from home and in a completely new environment. What about that makes a student feel comfortable?  </h4>

									<h4>The truth is there are a lot of discomforting things about the start of college and flight training. An instructor can help reinforce one's enjoyment for flying and remind the student why they started. Ultimately, growth comes from discomfort and there were many times I was out of my comfort zone in college, but those experiences allowed me to excel and gain critical skills. I never realized the importance of having a support system of likeminded individuals until my freshman year mostly because my private training was conducted at a Part 61 Flight School and I didn't know any other students there.</h4>
									<img src="images/IMG_2052.jpg" width="700" height="500" align="left"<h4>
									<h4>Getting involved in aviation organizations such as Alpha Eta Rho and Women in Aviation allowed me to form a strong support system and network with my peers. Flight training is arduous and taxing and no one should do it alone, so having a group of people in a similar place as you to encourage you is crucial. I have mentioned before the importance of building relationships and no matter what stage of your flight training or career you are, having an extra team member on your side can only benefit you. </h4>

									<h4>2. There are other paths in aviation besides the airlines. </h4>
									<h4>One thing that I highly considered in my college choice was the airline pathway programs. College aviation programs make it easy for students to choose the obvious of a career with the airlines because students have a defined path to their end goal when they join pathway programs that the university is partnered with. </h4>

									<h4>However, there are so many avenues one's career as a pilot can follow from cargo to air ambulance to aerial firefighting to business aviation. If you have an interest in one of these fields, seek out a mentor to educate you about the industry. For me, I was blinded by visualizing myself in a career outside the airlines, but it took me venturing out of my comfort zone to be involved in Women in Corporate Aviation. Through this organization, I gained a mentor and my lens was opened to a world of possibilities and opportunities in business aviation. </h4>

									<h4>3. The college lifestyle is completely different from other majors, but it is so worth it. </h4>
									<h4>Attending college as a flight student forced me to make many sacrifices in my three years. From weather delays to varied aircraft availability, I found myself always trying to take advantage of the next opportunity to fly to stay on track for my planned graduation. This sometimes meant flying on an early Saturday or Sunday morning or remaining on campus for a few days during a school break to catch up on flying. I also had to spent most days of my sophomore year at the airport working on my instrument rating and commercial certificate to ensure I completed those courses and I could get a summer internship.</h4>

									<h4>As I am a senior, I am realizing that many of my friends in other fields have jobs lined up, but as a flight student it is difficult to land a pilot job without possessing a Certified Flight Instructor rating or having close to 500 hours. However, being so close to graduating it is so exciting to see the myriad of opportunities available once I gain more flight hours. After all, how many other students at your university can say they go to class to fly a plane? I am extremely lucky to attend school to fly airplanes and have the best classroom view!</h4>

									<h4>On another note, I am really excited to be attending the Women in Aviation Conference in two weeks.

									<h1><strong>Get-There-Itis<strong></h1>
									<h2 class="colorlib-heading">Aviation Safety |  February 25, 2022</h2>
									<h4></h4>
									<h4>I recently covered an <a href ="https://www.globalair.com/Articles/Aborted-takeoff-sends-Hawker-800XP-off-runway-and-closes-Aspen-Airport?Id=4288">aircraft accident that occurred on takeoff at the Aspen-Pitkin County Airport this past week.</a> A <a href="https://www.globalair.com/aircraft-for-sale/ListingDetail/Hawker-800XP?AdId=123675">Hawker 800XP</a> was attempting to takeoff with almost a direct tailwind of 16 knots gusting to 25 and likely wasn't able to get the required performance to rotate in time. The aircraft came to rest on airport property and all crewmembers and passengers were able to safely evacuate. The aircraft will not see the skies again and was moved by a crane for FAA and NTSB investigation purposes. </h4>

									<h4>This event calls to mind one thing we commonly hear in relation to general aviation accidents: get-there-itis. There is a bias among pilots to reach their destination despite changing conditions, which creates a slippery slope in terms of safety. As pilots, safety should always be our number one priority and we must weigh all the hazards associated with flight. In the case of the Hawker, the winds at the time would've exceeded their operational limitations making a takeoff on the one way out runway 33 at Aspen very dangerous. </h4>

									<h4>One of the most hazardous aspects of get-there-itis is that pilots don't realize their mindset until they are harshly impacted by their decision. That is why it is crucial to develop foundational habits that you will carry with you throughout your career. </h4>

									<h4>Here are a few tips to avoid get-there-it is: </h4>
									<h4>1. Have Alternative Plans in Place: When you develop alternative options to a flight, there is less pressure to make the original plan happen in the event of a significant hazard or hazards.</h4>
									<h4>2. Develop Personal Minimums: Know what is within your comfort as a manipulator of the controls. </h4>
									<h4>3. Take Command: Don't let anyone else tell you something is possible. You know your own capabilities and the capabilities of your aircraft better than anyone else. </h4>
									<h4>4. Don't Rush: Time is always on our side until it isn't because something was rushed. Spend time looking at all aspects of the trip and know that there is no need to rush because when you do, you neglect important checks. </h4>

									<h4>A good pilot is always learning and there are so many tools to better yourself as a pilot. Check out the AOPA Air Safety Institute or some of the free courses Embry-Riddle offers to advance your safety mindset and awareness. Stay safe in the skies! Blue skies and tailwinds (in cruise)!</h4>
									<h1><strong>Why Business Aviation?<strong></h1>
									<h2 class="colorlib-heading">Business Aviation |  February 18, 2022</h2>
									<h4></h4>
									<h4>When I first began my flight training, I set my goals on achieving my dream of being an international long-haul Captain for Delta Airlines. At the time, that was the biggest dream I could think of and the airlines and cargo were the only path in aviation I knew. However, a few months later my aunt was returning to a career as a pilot and as a corporate pilot nonetheless. Having her as my role model as I ventured through training, I decided to explore a different path in aviation, one that is often overlooked by students: business aviation.</h4>

									<h4>My exposure to business aviation began my senior year of high school when I attended Girl's in Aviation Day at a local corporate flight department in Detroit. I was enamored by the advanced and pristine <a href="https://www.globalair.com/aircraft-for-sale/ListingDetail/Falcon-2000LX?AdId=123071">Dassult Falcon 2000LXS</a> and <a href="https://www.globalair.com/aircraft-for-sale/ListingDetail/Phenom-300?AdId=124076">Embraer Phenom 300</a> aircraft this flight department operated. Ultimately, it was not the planes that left me itching to learn more about business aviation, but it was the people. I met numerous corporate pilots and mechanics who were so enthusiastic about my future. I keep in touch with some of them and it is rewarding for me to think about how their support has helped me get to where I am. </h4>

									<h4>So why has my dream shifted from being a Delta pilot to be a Chief Pilot at a Fortune 500 or similar corporate flight department? Through my internships, I learned that there is much diversity in the type of flying corporate pilots do. I enjoy the freedom to plan flights and accomplish the performance and weight and balance calculations on my own. I also like the reward that accompanies completing a mission for a corporation. As a corporate pilot, you are enabling a corporation to be much more efficient and productive with their time.</h4>

									<h4>The most important part of it comes down to the idea that in a corporate flight department, I can be a name and not a number. Many corporate flight departments embody a family-like atmosphere where individuals can build relationships both within their corporation and in the business aviation community. In addition, the opportunity to do more outside of flying duties enthralls me as I am passionate about leadership and safety.</h4>

									<h4>Obviously, there are downsides to any job, but for me, my career is about achieving maximum happiness and success and I believe that is in business aviation. If you are interested in talking more about business aviation, please reach out to me. I enjoy sharing my love for this sector of aviation with others and I will do anything to help someone get their start in it. There are a myriad of internship and mentorship opportunities available to students in the field!</h4>
									<h1><strong>Another Flight from the Right Seat<strong></h1>
									<h2 class="colorlib-heading">Flight Training |  February 11, 2022</h2>
									<h4></h4>
									<h4>After a few days of being grounded from flight operations last week due to a winter storm that came through St. Louis, I was excited to get back in the air this week. This week was accompanied by a warm front, so it definitely felt like a tease to be pre-flighting in 50 degree weather in February. But I am not complaining!</h4>

									<h4>On Wednesday, I flew in the right-seat of the Piper Archer TX with my instructor for another essential flight in my training to becoming a Certified Flight Instructor. It was interesting to see the massive snow mounds on the ramp as we taxied from the secluded Parks ramp on the airport to the larger, main ramp for run-up. Despite most of the snow on the ground melting, these mounds held up well and forced me to exercise additional situational awareness to maneuver around them to find a spot for my run-up among the other Parks <a href ="https://www.globalair.com/aircraft-for-sale/ListingDetail/Archer-II-PA-28-181?AdId=123101">Archers</a>, DA20s, and <a href ="https://www.globalair.com/aircraft-for-sale/ListingDetail/Seneca-V-PA-34-220T?AdId=123467">Seminoles</a> on the ramp.</h4>

									<h4>The St. Louis Downtown Airport (CPS) has two parallel runways with the smaller of the two being used for flight training when there is inbound or outbound jet traffic. However, they typically don't clear the snow on the smaller parallel runway, which made for an unfavorable condition in accomplishing what we needed to do on this flight - traffic pattern. As a result, we departed the airport and headed north to St. Louis Regional Airport (ALN) to join their pattern and practice various takeoffs and landings.</h4>

									<h4>I always enjoy the few times I get to fly up to ALN (not with foggles on) because we fly along the St. Louis skyline as compared to our typical departure to the south to join our practice area for maneuvers. This flight was no different, but sitting in the right seat I taught my "student" how to use pilotage to reach ALN, get the ATIS, and call up tower to request the option for pattern work.</h4>

									<h4>We arrived at ALN to an empty pattern and a bored tower controller who enjoyed watching each of my 7 landings and cleared us to land when I was on upwind each time. After a few landings we were joined by a helicopter doing touch and goes on the same runway, which was fun to watch. I am getting more comfortable in the right seat and explaining things is becoming second nature as I gain more experience. This flight provided me a great environment to practice teaching the different methods for crosswind correction on landing. Although CFI training is not easy, I have learned and grown a lot in my short time thus far in the course. Stay tuned for more takeaways on my continued journey to becoming a CFI. Blue skies!</h4>
									<h1><strong>The Piper Archer<strong></h1>
									<h2 class="colorlib-heading">Flight Training |  February 4, 2022</h2>
									<h4></h4>
									<h4>An important part of deciding where you will pursue flight training is the school's fleet of aircraft. This was certainly the case for me as Saint Louis University had just announced their order of four new Piper Archer TX aircraft in 2018, months before I was to make my college decision. This brand new line of aircraft diversified the school's fleet and provided a "technically advanced aircraft" (TAA) option for students advancing to instrument and commercial phases of their training. A technically advanced aircraft is defined as an aircraft with a primary flight display, a multifunction display, and a two-axis autopilot integrated into the navigation and heading guidance system. The technically advanced aspect of the aircraft satisfies requirements for students obtaining their commercial certificate as ten hours in the aircraft are required to take the commercial check ride. </h4>
									<img src="images/Archer.jpg" width="700" height="500" align="left"<h4>
									<h4>Having completed my private pilot training in <a href ="https://www.globalair.com/aircraft-for-sale/ListingDetail/Archer-PA-28-180?AdId=93121">Piper Archer</a> and Warrior aircraft during high school, I knew flying a Piper Archer TX at SLU was a safe and reliable choice in pursuing the rest of my training. The Archers are equipped with state-of-the-art Garmin G1000 NXi and Aspen Evolution Backup Display system, which provides superior situational awareness to pilots. The Garmin G1000 NXi is a simplified version of the Garmin G3000 and Garmin G5000 seen in business jets such as the Embraer Phenom and Cessna Citation lines, which will better prepare me to transition to a flying environment of that nature in the future. In addition, the aircraft is equipped with the GFC 700 Autopilot - a two-axis autopilot with servo control. </h4>

									<h4>Another aspect of the aircraft I particularly like in addition to the technological advancements is the manual flaps. Some aircraft, such as the Diamond DA20 that I flew for my instrument training, are equipped with electronic flaps, which doesn't have an immediate effect when the pilot commands the flaps to move. With the manual flaps, the pilot extends the flaps with the lever and performance is changed immediately as compared to a few second delay with the electronic flaps.</h4>

									<h4>The Piper Archer is a spectacular aircraft for cross country flying with its seamless design and exceptional comfort. In my 112 hours in the Archer, I can only say positive things about the aircraft. One thing that has stood out to me is the low time that the aircraft spend in maintenance. There is never a time I don't get an aircraft when I want to fly because the Archer is a well-engineered aircraft made to fly and not be in the maintenance shop. The remainder of my CFI course at SLU consists of about 20 hours in the Archer. Hopefully, my future consists of more opportunities to fly the amazing Piper Aircraft line such as the M350, <a href ="https://www.globalair.com/aircraft-for-sale/ListingDetail/M-Class-M600?AdId=93120">M600/SLS</a>, or Seneca. </h4>
									<h1><strong>EAA AirVenture<strong></h1>
									<h2 class="colorlib-heading">General Aviation |  January 28, 2022</h2>
									<h4></h4>
									<h4>Everyone in the aviation community knows of the annual summer fly-in, EAA AirVenture, and if you have not been before, you are certainly missing out. This past summer I attended EAA AirVenture at Wittman Regional Airport (OSH) for the first time. People from all over the world travel to be among nearly 600,000 other aviation enthusiasts during the week-long airshow and gathering. After 2020 AirVenture was cancelled due to COVID, aviators were eager to gather in 2021 and be a part of the comradery the airshow brings.</h4>

									<h4>My dad and I decided a few days before the air show was set to begin that we would make the drive to eastern Wisconsin to attend Oshkosh for a couple of days. The two days we planned to spend at the airshow were simply not enough as hours before we left OSH we were discovering new displays and seeing aircraft we had yet to see. It was energizing to be among such diverse aircraft and young and old aviators  with a range of experience and expertise. In the two days I was there, I connected with numerous individuals many of whom I have kept in touch with since.</h4>
									<img src="images/IMG_9242.jpg" width="500" height="700" align="right"<h4>
									<h4>I can't begin to describe the thrill I felt as I was immersed in all things aviation at Oshkosh. Although we did not stay until Wednesday for the night airshow, the day time airshow was definitely the highlight both days. In my previous blog, I wrote about my UPRT instructor who is on the Geico SkyTypers, which performed at Oshkosh. It was cool to see the team fly and to know that I received instruction from such a reputable aerobatic pilot. In addition to the airshows, I enjoyed walking around the static displays and I took an interest in aircraft sales after speaking to professionals who are demonstration pilots for aircraft manufacturers such as <a href ="https://www.globalair.com/aircraft-for-sale/ListingDetail/Cirrus-SR22-G6?AdId=123938">Cirrus</a>, <a href="https://www.globalair.com/aircraft-for-sale/ListingDetail/M-Class-M350?AdId=123091">Piper</a>, <a href ="https://www.globalair.com/aircraft-for-sale/ListingDetail/Cessna-T206H?AdId=123307">Textron</a>, and <a href ="https://www.globalair.com/aircraft-for-sale/ListingDetail/Diamond-DA40-NG?AdId=82122">Diamond</a>. </h4>

									<h4>My first experience at Oshkosh came with many memories and new connections. I learned things that will be crucial to my next visit such as not cramming everything into two days and that the night airshow is a must. I look forward to making Oshkosh a yearly tradition with my dad (work schedules permitting) and maybe even flying in to the event in the future. If you haven't made plans to attend the AirVenture, it is never too late!</h4>

									<h4>Sun 'N Fun is another yearly airshow known to many aviators that is approaching this April in Lakeland, Florida. It is a goal of mine to attend in the future. This year GlobalAir is an official media sponsor of the event. If you aren't already subscribed, you'll want to get on the weekly GlobalAir Airmail News list to stay up to date on relevant aviation news. </h4>
									<h1><strong>UPRT Training<strong></h1>
									<h2 class="colorlib-heading">Flight Training |  January 21, 2022</h2>
									<h4></h4>
									<h4>As loss of control inflight (LOC-I) accidents are the leader of fatalities in general aviation accidents, one way to mitigate the risk of LOC-I is to complete Upset Prevention & Recovery Training (UPRT). No matter where you may be in your aviation career, attending UPRT can have immense benefits on your ability to react to upsets and be an overall safer pilot.</h4>

									<h4>I had the privilege of attending a UPRT ground school course and completing a flight in the EXTRA 300 aircraft at Prevailance Aerospace through my internship this past summer. The ground school was some of the most valuable flight training education I have received and I apply many of the concepts I learned during the 3-day course in my current training and flying.</h4>
									<img src="images/UPRT2.jpg" width="700" height="500" align="right"/><h4>
									<h4>I have always enjoyed flying because of the thrill it brings, but flying aerobatics in an EXTRA 300 brought about a thrill unlike any other. The instructors at Prevailance Aerospace are extremely knowledgeable and amazing pilots as many of them are former military pilots and some of them are now members of the famous air show team, The Geico Skytypers. In my hour-long flight, I not only flew simulated stalls and spins, but I also did hammerheads, aileron rolls, Cuban 8s, loops, and an inverted spin. It was thrilling to be able to see the curvature of the earth while upside down from the cockpit of an amazing aircraft and use the knowledge I had gained through the ground lessons to react effectively to the upsets we experienced.</h4>

									<h4>I am so grateful for the ground and flight training I received that made me a better pilot and I am eager to complete a full UPRT course in my future. Not only should all professional pilots complete UPRT, but I also believe that collegiate aviation programs should incorporate it into their commercial or CFI training programs. There are a few great scholarships for those who wish to pursue UPRT training such as the Aviation Performance Solutions UPRT Scholarship, Figure 1 Foundation Upset Recover/Spin Training and Introduction to Aerobatics, Greg Koontz Airshows Aerobatic Instructor Scholarship, and IAC Emergency Maneuver Training Scholarship.</h4>

									<h4>The aerobatic sector of aviation is one that amazes me everyday. I love watching airshows and seeing such beautifully designed aircraft fly fast and be capable of such intricate maneuvers. GlobalAir.com also has a few aerobatic aircraft on their line right now including the <a href="https://www.globalair.com/aircraft-for-sale/ListingDetail/Staudacher-S-300D?AdId=91391">1991 Staudacher S-300D</a> and <a href="https://www.globalair.com/aircraft-for-sale/ListingDetail/Midget-Mustang-M-I?AdId=66223Midget">Mustang Goodyear Pylon Racer.</a> As I go through my CFI training, I am excited for my spin training flight in the Diamond DA-20 as I am sure it will bring a similar thrill that the EXTRA 300 did.</h4>


									<h1><strong>Aviation Involvement<strong></h1>
									<h2 class="colorlib-heading">Involvement |  January 14, 2022</h2>
									<h4></h4>
									<h4>Today's blog speaks to how I put my passions to work in my time at SLU and how that enabled me to grow personally and professionally. The last semester of my undergraduate education means some of my involvements in extra-curriculars will begin to dwindle down, so I will discuss how I was active a few organizations during my education. When I began my journey in aviation as a student pilot, I would never have imagined what a fulfilling career it would be and how many amazing people and relationships I would be able to build. I quickly became immersed in a community of aviation enthusiasts who strive to better the future of the pilots around them. Attending a reputable collegiate aviation program served me well not only because of the stellar education, but also because of the established organizations and ability to be voice among my peers.</h4>

									<h4>One of the first organizations I became a member of my freshman year was Alpha Eta Rho (AHP) - the professional collegiate aviation fraternity. This organization introduced me to a group of likeminded and passionate students whose goals aligned with mine. Many of the upper class students in AHP at the time were integral to my success as I transitioned into Parks College. As a member of Alpha Eta Rho, I have engaged in community service with our philanthropy Wings of Hope headquartered at the Spirit of St. Louis Airport (SUS) over the last two and a half years. I have also had the opportunity to network with a handful of professionals and hear stories about individuals who come from all different walks of aviation. Although my time in AHP is coming to a close, my roots in the fraternity are engrained in me with the motto "Collegiate Aviation Leaders of Today...Aviation Industry Leaders of Tomorrow."	</h4>

									<h4>When I came to SLU, I quickly realized Parks College did not have an active Women in Aviation Chapter. The need to establish a chapter for females to be supported and encouraged in a male-dominated field became immediate to me. My freshman year, in March of 2020, I along with three other female students and two males from Parks College attended the Annual Women in Aviation Conference. This event gave me the motivation and enthusiasm and I was determined to grow our chapter. Not many weeks after, the pandemic began, which placed an immense burden on one of my goals. However, the next fall when classes resumed on-campus in a hybrid format, the successor president and I met to brainstorm our ideas for member engagement. In the 2020-2021 school year, we went from only a handful of members to establishing a strong group of six executive board members which enabled us to hold bimonthly Zoom meetings with industry speakers while anticipating a successful future of growth for our organization. I served as Vice President beginning in the fall of 2020 and in the spring of 2021, I assumed the President role. From 2021 to now, we grew to 54 members and we have been successful at engaging in-person through bimonthly meetings and monthly social events that include professional development, industry tours, networking among the group, and giving back to the surrounding St. Louis community. I will shortly turn my President hat in to watch the next group of students lead and carry on the success that a few of my peers and I instilled in our program.</h4>

									<h4>I am certainly looking forward to transitioning into my profession and being active in my regional business aviation association while continuing to be a member of Women in Aviation and Women in Corporate Aviation. Being involved in these groups and other mentorships as a student has allowed me to sit in the cockpit of <a href="https://www.globalair.com/aircraft-for-sale/ListingDetail/Gulfstream-G550?AdId=123556">Gulfstream G500 and simialr private jets.</a> and it is my goal to show students in the jets I fly in my future and expose them to business aviation. In my time at Saint Louis University, I am most proud of my ability to find my voice to share the influence of females in the field. As a result of these experiences, I grew immensely and learned key lessons in being a team member and leader.</h4>

									<h4>With a new semester starting on Monday, I have a new schedule of classes. Thus, the day my blog will be posted this semester will be every Friday morning.</h4>

									<h1><strong>CRJ-700 Simulator Course<strong></h1>
									<h2 class="colorlib-heading">Flight Training |  January 3, 2022</h2>
									<h4></h4>
									<h4>The classes I have taken at Parks College have been engaging and beneficial to my future, but I have most enjoyed progressing through the primary aviation courses to reach more advanced courses that prepare me the most to enter the aviation field as a professional. One of the courses I finished this past semester was Introduction to Flight Crew Operations and Laboratory, which is a course taught by a regional airline pilot and modeled around the Bombardier Canada Regional Jet (CRJ) 700. A few years ago Bombardier announced they would concentrate their manufacturing efforts in business jets, but hundreds of Bombardier CRJ's still remain in the skies and are a popular carrier for many United States commercial airline carriers such as SkyWest, Endeavor, PSA, and Air Wisconsin. Global Air currently has an aircraft that is similar to the CRJ on the market - <a href="https://www.globalair.com/aircraft-for-sale/ListingDetail/Embraer-ERJ-145LR?AdId=91842">the Embraer ERJ-145LR.</a> For many aspiring aviators who wish to gain a pilot position in the airline industry upon reaching their 1000 or 1500 hours, they will likely begin flying on a CRJ or ERJ.</h4>
									<img src="images/crj700.jpg" width="600" height="500" align="left"/><h4>
									<h4>Although Parks does not have a course to make the transition into business aviation more seamless for students, this airline centric course paralleled a variety of aspects to corporate flying. The course consisted of a three hour ground school and a two hour simulator once a week. In the spring, I am enrolled in the advanced portion of this year-long course, which has the same format. A prerequisite of this course was a yearlong course on Jet Systems last year, so the bulk of the course material for the semester consisted of learning Billiken Air Express Standard Operating Procedures, autopilot, FMS setup, checklist usage and flows, profiles and emergency procedures. Much of what was learned in the ground portion transferred into what we did in the simulator each week. Flows and proper crew communication were an integral part of each lesson while certain lessons focused on takeoffs, SIDs and STARs, non-precision and precision approaches, missed approaches, and engine-out takeoffs and approaches.</h4>

									<h4>Ultimately, this course is crucial for establishing strong habits and learning to communicate with crew members to make decisions no matter what path students choose to venture into upon graduation. I am looking forward to the more advanced course next semester and to honing my knowledge and flying skills in the simulator. I have many exciting projects on the rise in the upcoming months, so check back for more stories on what I will be working on during my last semester of college.</h4>
									<h1><strong>Wrapping Up the Year<strong></h1>
									<h2 class="colorlib-heading">About Me |  December 27, 2021</h2>
									<h4></h4>
									<h4>I am back in Michigan for a much needed winter break before my last semester of undergraduate begins in mid-January. Usually when I am back in Michigan, I rent a <a href+"https://www.globalair.com/aircraft-for-sale/Diamond-DA40-XLT">Diamond DA20 or similar</a> from a local flight school at Oakland County International (KPTK). I wasn't planning on the winter weather in Michigan being favorable for flying, so I decided to focus on taking my Fundamentals of Instruction and Flight Instructor Airplane exams and getting ahead on my CFI lesson plans.</h4>
									<img src="images/detroit.jpg" width="600" height="500" align="right"/><h4>
									<h4>As 2021 draws to a close, I have been reflecting a lot on the triumphs and trials of the year and most importantly the growth I experienced both personally and professionally. In 2021, I flew 73 flight hours (not including all the time I spent jump seating on the Challenger 350). Looking back, this will likely be the least amount of hours I will fly in a year the rest of my career as a pilot. This year, I had two spectacular internships. In one of my first blogs in September, I described my previous internship experiences and mentioned that my time as an intern was over. Little did I know at that time that I would receive an offer to work for Garmin in St. Louis as an Aeronautical Data Analyst Intern. This internship kept me busy over the semester and exposed me to the aeronautical data articulation process. It wasn't easy managing a heavy course load, flight training, various extracurriculars, and an internship this past fall, but all these experiences have allowed me to grow and learn how to effectively manage my time.</h4>

									<h4>In terms my development as a pilot, I obtained my commercial single-engine and multi-engine ratings, learned about and was exposed to my first ever business jet, and took an upset prevention and recovery training course. Much of my knowledge and growth as a pilot can be attributed to my summer internship in business aviation. Beyond the technical skills I gained, the most important thing I learned was the value of building relationships within aviation.</h4>

									<h4>The year 2022 brings me much excitement as I consider the goals I have made for myself. Some of those goals include obtaining my CFI and CFII, finding new ways to give back to the aviation community, getting more involved with certain organizations, continuing my blog after graduation, and maybe even getting my first type rating (but that is a reach). I can't say where in the country I will be or where I will be working once I graduate in May, but I know I will be happy as long as I am meeting new people, gaining new experiences, and developing myself professionally while working towards my short and long-term goals. I can't thank you all for reading my blog whether it is every week an hour after I post (thanks Mom) or every once in a while. I am grateful this blog has given me the opportunity to share my experiences and connect with new people. I look forward to seeing what 2022 brings!</h4>
									<h1><strong>A Hot Aircraft Market<strong></h1>
									<h2 class="colorlib-heading">General Aviation |  December 13, 2021</h2>
									<h4></h4>
									<h4>The General Aviation Manufacturers Association (GAMA) recently released their third-quarter report, which showed the aviation industry's strength as it grapples with pandemic-driven impacts. Many of these setbacks within the aircraft market are related to the global supply chain shortage as well as the labor shortage the nation is enduring. Compared to the same period of 2020, turboprop business jet, and helicopter deliveries increased in the first nine months of 2021. The only aircraft type that showed a decrease in shipments was piston airplanes.</h4>

									<h4>Not only are operators and owners trying to hire qualified pilots and mechanics, but they are also placing orders for new jets. Many of the people contributing to the surge for aircraft are first time buyers as orders in the third quarter rose more than 50% over the pat year according to Gulfstream, Cessna,, Bombardier and Embraer - the four largest manufacturers of business jets. Gulfstream faces its largest backlog of orders in six years and Embraer is sold out of jets until quarter one of 2023.</h4>

									<h4>Not only are new aircraft unavailable for quite some time, but there is also a shortage of used aircraft. However, one thing remains and it is that <a href="https://www.globalair.com/aircraft-for-sale/ListingDetail/Gulfstream-G550?AdId=123680">GlobalAir</a> has a wide selection of aircraft on their site with new aircraft coming to the market each week. There is no doubt that a plane buyer will be dissatisfied by the plane availability. I heard from a source last week that used Challenger 300s with hundreds of hours are going for the same price as brand-new Challenger 350s. Also, a study done by JPMorgan showed that the average asking price for a used jet increased to $10.7 million in October, about $1 million higher than its pre-pandemic level two years ago.</h4>

									<h4>Many individuals who had no previous exposure to the flexibility, time-savings, and increased productivity accompanied with utilizing business aircraft are now realizing the myriad of benefits. All in all, despite the challenges manufacturers face with the supply-chain and labor, the hot aircraft market shows that the aviation industry perseveres and continues to make advances. This is also great news for pilots like myself who find commercial aviation may not be for them as many jobs within business aviation may become available.</h4>
									<h1><strong>A Successful Engine Failure Execution & Turnback From a Viral YouTube Video<strong></h1>
									<h2 class="colorlib-heading">General Aviation |  December 6, 2021</h2>
									<h4></h4>
									<h4><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FdRQiHyWQs&t=53s">A recent YouTube video posted by Edward Frye</a>, the pilot and owner of a <a href="https://www.globalair.com/aircraft-for-sale/ListingDetail/Cessna-210?AdId=123587">Cessna 210 Centurion</a>, has been shared across the aviation community after he experienced an engine failure shortly after takeoff from runway 30 and executed a 220-degree turn to safely land on runway 8 at Tracy Municipal Airport (TCY) in California.</h4>

									<h4>I recently heard a joke that a student and instructor were practicing engine failures and the instructor pulled the throttle to idle in a single-engine aircraft to simulate an engine failure. The student responded by saying to start the timer for 30 seconds to account for human factors.</h4>

									<h4>In Frye's one-minute and 12 second weight-off-wheels flight, he had little time to analyze the various options following his catastrophic engine failure at a low altitude. He immediately flies the aircraft while continually evaluating the aircraft's performance during the turnback and approach to runway 8. An argument simply cannot be made about whether Frye made the right decision to turn back instead of landing on one of the flat fields in front of him since he walked away safely with no damage done to the structure of the aircraft.</h4>

									<h4>It is safe to say that due to the engine failure Frye experienced, his engine will endure another long repair process before his Cessna Centurion sees the skies again. I used the word "another" because this event occurred on the first flight following the overhaul of the engine which consisted of the replacement of the camshaft, lifters, bearings, connecting rod bolts, rings, honed cylinders, propeller, and propeller governor. The subsequent result of the overhaul was a rod failing in flight, which pierced a hole through the crankcase causing loss of engine oil and oil starvation.</h4>

									<h4>As I learned through glider training and doing Power Off 180s in commercial training, proper execution of returning to a runway for landing with no power or a simulated failed engine is all about airspeed management. Frye recognized when he was getting too slow and thus losing altitude faster, so he pushed the nose down to gain airspeed. Without the corrective measures he took to adjust airspeed, the risky turnback maneuver he executed would not have been so successful. However, he does put the gear down quite early when it is unclear whether landing on the airport environment is assured. Extending the gear creates additional drag and forces the aircraft to slow down.</h4>

									<h4>I commend Frye because he was very receptive to all the criticism he received in comments on his video. I noticed in his video that he completed checklists in a memory flow pattern, but he didn't go back through the checklist to verify each item was accomplished. As a result, this caused him to unintentionally neglect his shoulder harness, which could have been potentially dangerous in the event of an off-airport landing. Additionally, he did not verbalize his pre-takeoff briefing. In a comment on the video, he indicated he said it in his head. Frye admits he was in a hurry to get off the ground before sunset. The word "hurry" being used in aviation can be linked with something called get-there-it is and what is, in my opinion, the 6th hazardous attitude</h4>

									<h4>As for developing good habits in the aircraft, I always verbalize briefings and checklists whether I have a passenger or I am solo. If I conduct a specific checklist from a memory flow, I go through my paper checklist and verbalize each item right after. In my past, I have flown an aircraft fresh out of an engine overhaul and although I was extra cautious during the run-up and ground operations, my outlook when I line up on centerline and apply full power is the same every time. I am diligent in monitoring my engine gauges and prepared following a thorough briefing if an emergency occurs.</h4>

									<h4>Whether Frye should have landed in front of him or turned back will remain an active discussion within the aviation community. Due to his successful outcome, he displayed that with airspeed management and proper execution, it can be done. I would encourage every pilot to familiarize themselves with a safe altitude that is appropriate for a turnback and an altitude that would warrant an off-field landing in the event of an engine failure on climb out. It is highly beneficial to the aviation community that Frye shared this video as there is something everyone can learn by engaging in conversations of this nature.</h4>

									<h1><strong>A Different Kind of Flying<strong></h1>
									<h2 class="colorlib-heading">Flight Training  |  November 29, 2021</h2>
									<h4></h4>
									<h4>A few summers ago, I had the opportunity to attend a week-long gliding camp at Sugarbush Soaring in Vermont thanks to the generosity of the Flight Experience for Youth (FEFY) organization. Not only was this a great chance for me to be surrounded by likeminded youth aviators post high-school and learn from some of the most knowledgeable flight instructors, but it was a great taste of the world of soaring.</h4>

									<h4>Throughout my ten flights in various gliders from the Schleicher ASK-21 to the Politechnika Warszawska PW-6U, I became immersed in gliding and I developed a significant love for new-to-me type of flight. The calmness and tranquility mixed with the whistle of the air moving through the window when I pulled the hook to release the rope from the tow plane was unlike anything I had ever experienced before. I was particularly enamored with the varied challenge that gliding presented compared to power flying. Constantly working to find lift in the different forms from ridge to thermals to wave was fun, rewarding, and challenging as is any flight. It was such a contrast to the flying I had become accustomed to for the first 80 hours of my flight training and it greatly improved my stick and rudder skills.</h4>
									<img src="images/gliding.jpg" width="500" height="300" align="left"/><h4>
									<h4>Many people have the privilege of conducting their flight training in picturesque areas and although the fall foliage of Michigan and Southern Illinois can be beautiful, there was nothing like the scenic views I experienced in the Mad River Valley. With the booming thermals that July brought to the area, most flights I was able to get up to 7,000 or 8,000 MSL and see beyond the mountains to Lake Champlain. Although my instructors and I could have stayed in the skies for hours each flight, the heat and schedule restricted us to close to an hour each flight.</h4>

									<h4>Although there is in fact a significant group of aviators who own their own gliders, GlobalAir doesn't sell them. However, the 11:1 glide ratio of the <a href="https://www.globalair.com/aircraft-for-sale/ListingDetail/Diamond-DA40-XLT?AdId=82887">DA40 they have for sale</a> can provide some similar characteristics at times with the added reciprocating engine. I highly recommend every pilot tries out gliding and if you have the chance to go to Sugarbush Soaring, you will find the views and instructors to be unmatched. It is fun and different flying memories like this and flying aerobatics in the Extra 300 that gives me a broader perspective of general aviation and introduces me to some of my greatest mentors in aviation.</h4>
									<h1><strong>Switching Seats<strong></h1>
									<h2 class="colorlib-heading">Corporate Aviation  |  November 21, 2021</h2>
									<h4></h4>
									<h4>I haven't found myself at the controls since my multi-engine check ride, so I don't have a flight to talk about this week. However, the past two weeks I have been diving into the Fundamentals of Instruction of my CFI training. I plan to start flying next week and it will definitely take a few flights to get comfortable flying from the right seat. As I began thinking into the first few years of my career, I made the realization that all the flying I do will be from here on out will be from the right seat until I become a captain.</h4>
									<img src="images/SLUArcher.jpg" width="500" height="400" align="right" title="Carmelo Tundo of Aero Experience captured this moment of my instructor and I taxiing at CPS last March during my commercial training"/><h4>
									<h4>Since I was able to experience numerous flights from the cockpit of a Challenger 350 this past summer, I have been eager to find an opportunity in the right seat of a jet that is certified for single-pilot operations. A few months ago, I had a chance to get inside and learn about the Cessna Citation CJ4+. I didn't fly in the aircraft, so I can't discuss how it flew, but I can say that the cockpit is extremely pilot-friendly, especially for single pilot operations. Although many Cessna aircraft are outfitted with Garmin avionics, the CJ4 line has the Collins Aerospace Pro Line 21. Jets equipped with Garmin avionics offers a seamless transition for pilots from flight training environments that utilize Garmin G1000 or similar equipment. However, with my experience in the Challenger 350, the Pro Line 21 is easy to adapt to and use and it provides a handful of crucial data in an easy to read and interpret format.</h4>

									<h4>In fact, <a href="https://www.globalair.com/aircraft-for-sale/ListingDetail/Citation-CJ4?AdId=123460">GlobalAir is currently selling the brand new 2021 CJ4 Gen 2 with 0 hours</a>, which is an update to the CJ4+. Not only does this aircraft have great ramp appeal, but the performance and passenger experience it offers are unmatched. Finding myself in the right seat of one of these or a similar aircraft early in my career would be a dream come true to me. For now though, I am keeping my eyes set on my current goal of obtaining my CFI certificate one lesson plan and flight at a time. I look forward to sharing my experience as I move into the right seat next week.</h4>


									<h1><strong>Two Engines!<strong></h1>
									<h2 class="colorlib-heading">Flight Training  |  November 15, 2021</h2>
									<h4></h4>
									<h4>This past week I took and passed my commercial multi-engine add-on rating check ride! Since I already have my commercial license, the oral portion solely dealt with multi-engine aircraft performance, aerodynamics, and systems. One thing that is stressed in multi-engine training is that multi-engine aircraft can be more dangerous than single-engine aircraft due to the adverse effects the inoperative engine can create in the event of an engine failure. When an engine fails or is simulated failed, it is crucial to always fly the aircraft first by maintaining directional control and pitching for Vyse. Then, you want to assess the performance and decide whether you are in a safe place to troubleshoot, secure, and airstart or secure the aircraft and land as soon as possible. The flight portion consisted of slow flight, stalls (power-on, power-off, accelerated), a Vmc demo, steep turns, too many engine failures to count including a single engine instrument approach, an emergency descent and a short field takeoff and landing. Some key points the examiner stressed and told me most people get into trouble with on multi-engine flight portion is not adjusting for Vyse on the Vmc demo recovery, getting into uncomfortable attitudes while pitching down during the emergency descent, and not completing enough GUMP checks. I had a great check ride experience and I am excited for all the opportunities this new rating will open up for me!</h4>
									<img src="images/multi2.jpg" width="500" height="400" align="left"/><h4>
									<h4>All in all, multi-engine training was some of the most fun and challenging flight training I have completed to date. It was really rewarding to move into a larger, faster, and more complex aircraft and successfully apply my knowledge to fly the aircraft. The growth I experienced in my piloting abilities felt exponential in such a short amount of time in the aircraft. Through all of my training, the biggest takeaways I had was the importance of completing engine failure flows in a quick and efficient manner as well as staying ahead of the aircraft. With a faster aircraft, I noticed it was crucial to be on proper airspeeds and  not neglect GUMP (Gas - on, Undercarriage - down and locked, Mixture - full rich, Propellers - 2500 or Full) checks at the appropriate times in the pattern. I now have the required license and ratings for an Airline Transport Pilot license (ATP), but at 260 hours I have a ways to go until 1000 hours when I am eligible to take the ATP check ride. Maybe in the meantime I can find myself in the right seat of a <a href="https://www.globalair.com/aircraft-for-sale/ListingDetail/King-Air-250?AdId=123373">King Air</a>, or similar aircraft, but if not my flight training does not end here as I am now pursuing my Certified Flight Instructor rating. I am looking forward to the next few months of immense growth for me where I am transitioning from being a student to now being a teacher. It will be interesting to develop processes and ways of my own to effectively communicate information to students in order to maximize their learning.</h4>
									<h1><strong>My Parks College Experience<strong></h1>
									<h2 class="colorlib-heading">Flight Training  |  November 1, 2021</h2>
									<h4></h4>
									<h4>When choosing to pursue a career as a pilot, there is a wide range of decisions to be made regarding flight training such as Part 61 or Part 141, degree or no degree, ATP Program or university program, etc. One common outcome with all these programs is that by the end of it you will have all your ratings required for a career as a professional pilot. In today's blog, I wish to discuss factors contributing to my decision to pursue an aviation degree at Saint Louis University as well as share the positive experience I have had thus far. </h4>

									<h4>I began my college search knowing I wanted to study aviation and that I wanted a traditional college experience. Therefore, my search consisted of four year universities. Like many of my classmates and peers, I found myself googling "collegiate aviation programs." I quickly gravitated to what I found to be a list of top ranking aviation colleges and set my mind on a very well-known, large aviation college. One benefit of any Part 141 university is the R-ATP, which enables graduates of such programs to obtain their Airline Transport License at 1000 hours and 21 years old versus 1500 hours and 23 years old. Despite applying to six other schools, I was certain that this top ranking university was the place for me. I put my deposit down and soon after I began realizing that in a program so large I might just be a number and I may struggle to build valuable relationships with my peers and instructors. After I was placed on a year and a half waitlist for a flight slot at that university, I was certain there was somewhere else I could be more successful at. I toured SLU and I was caught on the family-like atmosphere.</h4>
									<img src="images/Nov1.JPG" width="500" height="400" align="left"/><h4>
									<h4>At SLU, a program of 124 students, I easily found my voice and developed meaningful relationships with those around me my freshman year. The program feels like a family and more importantly it is a tight-knit system of support as I know every instructor and most all the students. I was able to fly my second week of classes freshman year and in my two and a half years in the program there have only been a few times when I wasn't allocated an aircraft due to an aircraft to student shortage. The program has enabled me to get all my ratings while taking the summers off for internships and still graduate in three years. The university offers numerous scholarships for aviation students and flight training and the resources within the program and university are plentiful. Our department chair is known to reply to any student's email in about five minutes, which is remarkable and shows the administration's commitment to assisting students achieve their goals. This can be seen in our 71% program graduation rate from the recent Best Value Schools Top Pilot Schools where SLU was ranked No. 10. I truly believe that SLU trains its students to not only be competent pilots, but also prepares us to be more than a pilot and make our mark on the world.</h4>

									<h4/>Some other great things about the program include the 15 drive from main campus to the flight line, the fleet of 2019 Piper Archers <a href="https://www.globalair.com/aircraft-for-sale/ListingDetail/Archer-III-PA-28-181?AdId=122991">similar to this one</a>, and the meticulously maintained aircraft. One piece of advice I can't stress enough regardless of where you go or what you do is the importance of being proactive to reach your goals. </h4>

									<h1><strong>Sustainability in Flight Training<strong></h1>
									<h2 class="colorlib-heading">Flight Training  |  October 25, 2021</h2>
									<h4></h4>
									<h4>Flight schools all across the country are pumping hundreds and thousands of gallons of Avgas into their training aircraft every week and facing hefty fuel bills as a result. As the aviation industry moves towards a more sustainable future through the pledge to achieve net zero CO2 emissions by 2050, some makers and innovators in the flight training environment have been active in this initiative. With Diamond Aircraft's recent eDA40 announcement, they will remain a leader in innovation and the production of environmentally responsible training aircraft. Set to be certified in 2023, the aircraft will not only be economically conscious for our environment, but it will also be cost effective as it is estimated to reduce operating costs nearly 40% compared to traditional piston aircraft. The DC Fast Charging System of the aircraft is said to turn a depleted aircraft battery to full in 20 minutes which is ideal for quick turnarounds flights in the training environment.</h4>

									<h4>General aviation can also be more economically friendly and cost effective through training aircraft such as the DA40, DA42 and the Piper DX. Diamond Aircraft was the first to introduce Diesel piston single and multi-engine aircraft. This enables their aircraft to burn 50% less fuel and have lower operating costs compared to Avgas. Moreover, the Piper DX equipped with a Continental CD-155 nearly doubles the range of the aircraft and cuts the gallon per hour in half. These aircraft make general aviation more available across the globe since many countries beyond the United States face either difficulty obtaining or affording AvGas . It is a no brainer for flight schools to invest in aircraft like this now as they would save operating costs in the long run and contribute towards a more sustainable future for aviation. As GlobalAir always has the latest and greatest aircraft on the market, <a href="https://www.globalair.com/aircraft-for-sale/ListingDetail/Diamond-DA40-NG?AdId=82122">they currently have a DA40 NG available</a>, which will help save costs in the future and contribute to a cleaner environment.</h4>

									<h4>With the numerous airline pathway programs at Part 141 universities, it can be easy for one to quickly identify their future job. The number of students interested in corporate aviation like myself is very slim, but the demand for pilots, schedulers, and mechanics in the industry is present similar to the demand for airline professionals. Some may find the corporate pilot lifestyle is not for them, but I believe it is worth exposing students to it early on so they can identify if it is an option for their future.</h4>

									<h4>If it were not for a Girls in Aviation Day event hosted by Masco Corporation at DTW when I was a senior in high school, I am not sure I would have discovered corporate aviation and sought out internships in it. When I took over as Parks College Women in Aviation president last spring, I devised a range of events to engage members in the aviation industry beyond commercial aviation. This past Sunday, we hosted one of our first industry engagement events ever at a corporate flight department in the St. Louis area that operates a Phenom 300E, which is a larger option to <a href="https://www.globalair.com/aircraft-for-sale/ListingDetail/Phenom-100?AdId=123243">this low-time Phenom 100 that is on the market.</a> As the demand for business aviation increases, used business jets are difficult to come by and this is a rare find 2018 model.</h4>

									<h4>A vast majority of the thirty Parks College Women in Aviation members that attended this event had never sat in a private jet or seen the inside of the flight deck. Seeing their faces light up and their eyes wide when they stepped in the jet was so rewarding to me. They were also able to hear from and connect with the corporation's two pilots who both have a variety of background experience from airlines to Part 135. This event might have served to spark interest for some in business aviation, but my ultimate goal was to diversify the knowledge of my peers with regards to general aviation as well as introduce corporate flight department operations to many. If you are a student, I encourage you to attend events like this to learn more about various avenues in your respected field and also network as much as possible! And if you are an industry professional, please consider giving your time to mentor students and expose them to what you do. It means so much to us students and you could have an immense impact on the future of one or many of us.</h4>

									<h1><strong>Combating Imposter Syndrome in the Cockpit<strong></h1>
									<h2 class="colorlib-heading">Flight Training  |  October 11, 2021</h2>
									<h4></h4>
									<h4>Today's blog is aimed at both collegiate students and flight training students who may feel at times like they aren't good enough, that they don't have the skills or competence to successful perform during a flight, or that it is difficult to visualize themselves flying for an airline or getting a dream job one day. The feelings can be related to something known as imposter syndrome and this term comes from Pauline Clance, a psychologist, who studied the phenomenon and discovered 70% of people suffer from imposter syndrome. The self-doubt feelings encountered with imposter syndrome are heavily prevalent in high-achieving people, members of minority groups, and students.</h4>

									<h4>Flight training, let alone flight training at a Part 141 university, is both arduous and at times unforgiving. It is evident there are quite high standards we as students are held to in rigid and fast pace training program. Some students might wish to exceed the standards to the point they become unrealistic and other students may suffer from a lack of confidence. No matter where you may stand, it is important to know you are not alone and these are common feelings in student pilots which correlates to self-handicapping according to an Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University study called "What Type of Collegiate Pilot is Likely to Experience Imposter Syndrome?"</h4>

									<h4>In the desired path towards becoming professional pilots many of us share, the character required of a pilot seldom permits a weak appearance. The vast majority of us can agree that we don't openly choose to talk about insecurities and instead we allow ourselves to internalize them. If you find yourself fighting imposter syndrome, I encourage you to have the necessary conversations with your friends, family, flight instructor, or an individual you feel will support you. Without bringing these feelings to light, one is unable to grow their mindset and as a result they will reach difficulties in maximizing their performance.</h4>

									<h4>However, there are things you can do on your own to be proactive in countering imposter syndrome. The first step you can take is ensuring you are proficient in stick and rudder skills, procedures, checklists, airspace, and aircraft knowledge. We all have received the infamous "what's the difference between currency and proficiency" question on a check ride and we know the dangers of prolonged periods of not flying or not brushing up on ground knowledge. Another piece of advice is to reaffirm your abilities with positive statements such as being capable of passing. If you find yourself facing a setback or failure, understand that it is part of the process and these tribulations accompany great learning opportunities for the future. With every situation, there is always something positive, so focus on that and how you can better prepare yourself for the future. Lastly, understand what is factual such as passing the exam or possessing a certificate. The feelings you feel are not always true and may not be an accurate representation of yourself or your abilities.

							    <h4>Ultimately, these years are fundamental opportunities for learning and growth to mold us into successful and competent professional pilots. Determine what works best for you and do not be afraid to speak up if something doesn't feel right.</h4>

									<h4>This week, I want to highlight this beautiful aircraft <a href="https://www.globalair.com/aircraft-for-sale/ListingDetail/M-Class-M600?AdId=123156">Global Air has for sale - the Piper M600.</a> It would be a dream for me to find myself in the right seat of an aircraft of this kind. Maybe someday, but for now the Piper Seminole and Archer are where I will be.</h4>
									<h1><strong>An Eventful Seminole Flight<strong></h1>
									<h2 class="colorlib-heading">Flight Training  |  October 4, 2021</h2>
									<h4></h4>

									<h4>This past week, I ventured on my last cross country as a student at Parks College in the Piper Seminole to complete one of my last requirements prior to my multi-engine check ride. During my time as a student, some of the exciting places I have flown to include Madison, Nashville, the Ozarks, Memphis, and many other smaller cities surrounding St. Louis.</h4>

									<h4>One thing I didn't get to take advantage of due to the pandemic was the ability to take passengers on cross country flights. This flight was different for me because I was able to share general aviation with two of my friends who had little exposure to the field and collegiate flight training environment. To fulfill my course requirements, I had to fly a 2.0 day and 2.0 night cross country in the Piper Seminole with a majority of the time being under the hood. Unfortunately, it was a perfectly clear evening, so I had to put on the foggles instead of experiencing the excitement of shooting an approach close to minimums and logging actual time.</h4>
									<img src="images/IMG_0802.JPG" width="500" height="400" align="left"<h4>
									<h4>After noticing a broken fuel cap during preflight, we got on our way to the Kansas City Downtown Airport (MKC) from the St. Louis Downtown Airport (CPS) and flew direct before being vectored to the final approach course for the ILS Runway 19. On the ground, we enjoyed some of the best barbeque I have ever tasted before civil twilight began and I was able to log night hours. On the ground in Kansas City, my instructor and I noticed the aircraft was topped off by the FBO despite explicitly asking for a set number of gallons in each tank in order to meet takeoff weight. We sat on the ground for an extensive amount of time to burn off fuel in order to be within limits prior to takeoff. Despite some unexpected mishaps, it was a fun and memorable flight filled with much learning and the opportunity to refine my skills in the Seminole.</h4>

									<h4>It wouldn't be a multi-engine training flight without my instructor throwing an engine failure at me during the approach of both legs. Multi-engine training has been a fun challenge from quickly managing engine failures to learning more complex systems and the aerodynamics and characteristics associated with dual engines. The Piper Seminole is a great multi-engine trainer because it was designed for training with safety in mind. The late 1970s Seminole was well designed with a 56 KIAS VMC and 55 KIAS stall speed in landing configuration which is part of the reason it is a popular trainer among flight schools. The unfeathering accumulator allows for a failed engine to be airstarted by releasing oil pressure to the prop hub when the engine is unfeathered. Prior to Seminole's being made with unfeathering accumulators, the starter had to be engaged to get the propellor turning again after an in-flight failure.</h4>

									<h4>I would argue that there is one better trainer on the market for multi-engine training, especially for training students making the jump to airline and jet flying shortly. It is the DA42, <a href="https://www.globalair.com/aircraft-for-sale/ListingDetail/DA-42-VI?AdId=121880">which Global Air has on the market.</a> The single power lever control, FADEC, and feathering switch make the transition from DA42 to jet flying much easier. It is a long term cost effective option for a flight school because its Austro Engines burn fuel as if it were a single engine aircraft and they also take the cheaper alternative to 100LL - Jet A.</h4>
									<h1><strong>YES, You Can Do It!<strong></h1>
									<h2 class="colorlib-heading">Scholarships  |  September 27, 2021</h2>
									<h4></h4>

									<h4>When it comes to applying for scholarships, I have heard some of my peers  mention that scholarships are too competitive and that they have applied for a few, but never received any. I used to think the same thing early on in my flight training as I was antsy to be relieved of some of the private pilot license flight fees. However, instead I worked on building my experience and skillset so that I could someday be considered for scholarships.</h4>

									<h4>This is an ironic story, but one of the first scholarships I received in aviation was from the SoCal Pilots Association. I would have never thought to apply to this scholarship, but I had actually stumbled on a Global Air scholarship recipient's blog back in 2019 and she had just posted a list of scholarships to apply to. Now, here I am, writing to advise students of the numerous scholarships available to them and what they can do to help support the costs of an education in aviation.</h4>

									<h4>Since 2019 (my freshman year of college), I have submitted just over 100 scholarship applications and I am grateful to have received about 20 of them. They have not only been a huge assistance in my pursuit of a bachelors degree at Saint Louis University, but they have supported me financially in my flight training as well. Not only that, but the people and donors that I have connected with as a result of being a scholarship recipient have been so supportive and many of whom I keep in close contact with to this day.</h4>

									<h4>I think being persistent has helped me immensely in obtaining scholarships because I applied for the Global Air Scholarship three times and on the third time I was awarded the scholarship. If you don't get a scholarship, do not give up! Write it down and come back next year showing you have grown and gained new experiences. In addition, I applied for the Captain Jason Dahl Scholarship two times before receiving it. If you continually apply, the scholarship committee will likely recognize your name and application and take note of that.</h4>

									<h4>Some tips I have to share about applying to scholarships include:</h4>
									<li><h4>Join the professional organization offering the scholarship. Some scholarships that I know of like Women in Aviation and Women in Corporate Aviation require you be a member of their organization to apply for scholarships. If you think about it, the $30 membership will pay off if you take the chance and apply and only get one scholarships. Plus, you have access to so many benefits beyond scholarships such as mentorship and networking.</h4></li>
									<li><h4>It isn't always about which scholarship is the most money. Often times when there are organizations such as WAI that allow you to only pick 3 scholarships, people will gravitate to the 5,000-10,000 scholarships. However, because of that you will likely have a better chance applying for a lesser in value scholarship as it is not people's first choice.</h4></li>
									<li><h4>Follow all guidelines and make sure you check all the boxes for each requirement. Ask for letters of recommendations early as your recommenders will write higher quality letters when they know they are not in a time crunch. Check over all documents you submit for spelling errors.</h4></li>
									<li><h4>If you are on Facebook, join the group <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Aviation-Scholarships-1570860942960030/">Aviation Scholarships.</a> This page has been a great resource for me over the years and almost every aviation scholarship offered is posted here.</h4></li>
									<li><h4>Customize your essay or statement to echo what the scholarship committee is looking for. If it is in memory of someone, do research on what their impact to aviation was and relate that to what your future aspirations are.</h4></li>
									<li><h4>Be involved and help out in your community. People giving out scholarships are givers and want to see that you will do something to give back to your community. Find something in that area you are passionate about and do it.</h4></li>
									<li><h4>Lastly, ask for help! If you need someone to read over an essay, seek out someone who is willing to help. Don't be afraid to reach out to people. Believe in yourself and you will achieve outstanding things. If I can offer any support to you in your pursuit of a scholarship, please email me as I would be more than happy to help.</h4></li>

									<h4>I am heading on my commercial multi-engine cross country from CPS (St. Louis Downtown) to MKC (Kansas City Downtown) later this week in the Piper Seminole. Although my multi-engine training isn't conducted in an aircraft like <a href="https://www.globalair.com/aircraft-for-sale/ListingDetail/DA-62?AdId=123060">this Diamond DA62 that Global Air currently has for sale,</a> the Seminole is a great training aircraft and multi training has been a ton of fun. I am excited to share the details of this flight so check back in next Monday for that story!</h4>

									<h1><strong>Safety Culture in Collegiate Flight Training<strong></h1>
									<h2 class="colorlib-heading">Flight Training  |  September 20, 2021</h2>
									<h4></h4>

									<h4>I went through all of my private pilot training at a Part 61 school not knowing or being taught the importance of aviation safety. It wasn't that my training was conducted in an unsafe manner, but with operations out of one of the busiest general aviation airports in Michigan, there was bound to be hazards in our system which warranted mitigation. The depth of my safety mindset during my private training pertained to the infamous "IMSAFE" checklist and the airworthiness of the aircraft. Getting my private before entering a Part 141 collegiate aviation program had a major upside as it ultimately allowed me to graduate a year early, but I was also at a disadvantage because of the lack of a safety culture during the roots of my pilot training. When seeking out a Part 61 or 141 school to conduct your training at, I would highly advise asking whether the program has a Safety Management System (SMS), accident history, and what their safety culture is like. </h4>
									<img src="images/safety.jpg" width="400" height="600" align="right"<h4>
									<h4>I am grateful to have ended up at a university that is forward thinking in terms of safety and is working to develop a robust Safety Management System. Furthermore, it is even more beneficial to me to be involved in numerous decisions in terms of the safety of our flight training environment through my former role as ASAP leader and current role of PEDALS leader on the Parks College Aviation Safety Committee.</h4>

									<h4>For those of you that may not know what a Safety Management System is, it is a system designed to manage risk based on four pillars which include safety promotion, safety risk management, safety culture, and safety assurance. It is a requirement for all Part 121 commercial airlines to have a SMS and it will soon be a requirement for Part 135 charter operators. Although having a SMS isn't required for flight schools, I believe having a positive safety culture is crucial for students' futures and that begins with developing aspects of a SMS. </h4>

									<h4>The main aspect of our safety system at Parks College Center of Aviation Science is our PEDALS reporting system, which stands for Parks Event Debrief and Learning System. Students, instructors, dispatchers, and mechanics identify hazards in our training environment and as a committee we work together to mitigate the hazards in our system and inform the community of pertinent safety events. We also have a Flight Data Monitoring (FDM) system in our <a href="https://www.globalair.com/aircraft-for-sale/ListingDetail/Diamond-DA40-XLT?AdId=82887">Diamond 20</a>, <a href="https://www.globalair.com/aircraft-for-sale/ListingDetail/Archer-PA-28-180?AdId=93121">Piper Archer</a>, and Piper Seminole aircraft which has perimeters set and a flight is flagged and investigated when there are exceedances to the safe operating margins. It is important to mention these systems operate on the principle of just culture meaning that the organization understands that mistakes are apart of a system and therefore punitive actions against individuals are avoided. In addition, we send monthly safety newsletters and host semesterly safety standdowns. These events and systems help contribute to a positive safety culture in our community and also help students be better prepared to enter into an organization with robust safety programs. Safety in aviation is paramount and whether you are prospective flight student or current student, I would suggest asking questions to learn more about aviation safety. </h4>

									<h1><strong>Finding a Mentor<strong></h1>
									<h2 class="colorlib-heading">Networking  |  September 13, 2021</h2>

									<h4>It is never too early or too late in your career to find a mentor. Flight training is arduous and there are numerous highs and lows that accompany the journey of student to professional pilot. Mentors can serve a crucial role in encouragement, exposure, and advancement in one's future. I can attest that I would not be where I am if it weren't for my mentors offering constant support and pushing me towards my next goals.</h4>

									<h4>A mentorship can take the form of a formal or informal relationship. My aunt and cousin were my first mentors as I began my private pilot training. They provided me the resources to succeed and persevere when training became tedious and difficult. Furthermore, my older siblings served as an immense mentors for me. I witnessed them become leaders of their craft, giving back to others and impacting their communities in amazing ways and I was inspired to do the same. As a result of this mentorship from my family early on, I have high aspirations to serve as a mentor in my future for kids who don't come from an aviation family or may not have anyone to look to for support in their life. </h4>
									<img src="images/family.jpg" width="500" height="400" align="left"  title="My Aunt Adele, cousin Mikey, Andrew, and I celebrating my high school graduation"/><h4>
									<h4>When I arrived in St. Louis for my freshman year, I realized I was far from face-to-face family support and therefore, I sought a mentor in the area. I stumbled upon Women in Corporate Aviation, unbeknownst at the time that I was destined for a career in corporate aviation. I was paired with a mentor who flew a Gulfstream 500 and 600 in St. Louis similar to this aircraft currently on the market with <a href="https://www.globalair.com/aircraft-for-sale/ListingDetail/Gulfstream-G550?AdId=89878Global">Global Air.</a> At the time, I had only my private pilot license and my mentor  powered up the aircraft for me and spent an hour in the plane explaining the aircraft and its systems to me. Although our formal mentorship ended after a year, she continues to serve as a foundation of support and she has connected me to numerous individuals in the industry who I also often look to for encouragement. </h4>

									<h4>If you are lost on how to go about finding a mentor, I have some helpful tips that could lead to you gaining a lifelong mentor. </h4>
									<li><h4>Look into professional organization mentorship programs Some examples include Women in Corporate Aviation, Women in Aviation, National Business Aviation Association, Airline Pilots Association, etc. The National Business Aviation Association is assigning mentors to mentees from now until September 30th. You can make a profile and choose an industry professional to serve as your mentor. All of the listed mentors have a long list of impressive accomplishments and can be a great source of networking as well as learning leadership skills that you can transfer into your everyday life. Gain a mentor today at <a href="https://mentoring.nbaa.org/home">NBAA</a></h4></li>
									<li><h4>Connect with professionals on LinkedIn.I recently spoke to a friend wanting to greater expose himself to corporate aviation. He found pilots at Fortune 500 companies and connected with them on LinkedIn and sent a message to them requesting to form a mentorship. He has had numerous phone calls with some of them and has successfully gained mentors that way.</h4></li>
									<li><h4>A mentor doesn't have to be in the same career field as you. During my internship this past summer, I gained great perspectives from company employees who were engineers and business people. As a young professional, I believe these perspectives helped me develop and advance myself on another level. Mentorships both within your industry and outside of your industry help contribute to a well-rounded professional who is able to adapt to a range of environments and personalities.</h4></li>

									<img src="images/Andrew.JPG" width="500" height="600" align="right"><h4>

									<h4>If you are just beginning your training or education and are looking for advice from someone who recently went through those stages, I have extensive knowledge I can share with you. Please don't hesitate to reach out for support. Aviation is a tight-knit community and I have never met anyone who wasn't willing to help me advance myself in the industry, so I am happy to do my part in giving back to this amazing community.</h4>

									<h4>This weeks post is in remembrance of my cousin and mentor, Andrew St. Denis. Andrew was 26 and passed away a few days ago in a car accident. He was just nearing his check ride to become an Airline Transport Pilot for Republic Airways and he had a successful career ahead of him in commercial aviation. Throughout my flight training and life he served as a huge mentor to me and he was a pilot I aspired to mimic in my future. It was his mom, a medevac pilot, who gave me the motivation to enter aviation and Andrew helped propel me even further in it. I know he will always be there with me when I take to the skies. The future of aviation lost one of its best, but I know Andrew's legacy in the skies will be well carried by all those who he touched. Fly high, Andrew, and blue skies and tailwinds up there. </h4>

									<h1><strong>Industry Experiences Early On<strong></h1>
									<h2 class="colorlib-heading">Professional Development  |  September 6, 2021</h2>

									<img src="images/intern1.JPG" width="500" height="400" align="right"/><h4>
									<h4>Whether you're a student or industry professional, the value of internships on one's future can not be understated. For the industry professionals, if you don't already have an internship program established, I highly recommend bringing the idea to fruition. For the students, you will not regret obtaining an internship for a summer or semester during your college years. I always tell my peers that flight training and classes can be done at any time, but the opportunity to get real industry experience and work alongside distinguished professionals early on in your career journey is rare.</h4>

									<h4>Following my freshman year at SLU, I caught a glimpse of Part 135 and 91 operations through an internship with Pentastar Aviation in Waterford, Michigan. Although it was not a typical internship experience due to COVID, it was so valuable to gain hands-on experience in the Operations Control Center at Pentastar while most of the country worked from home. As a Flight Follower Intern, I was tasked with the behind the scenes jobs such as ensuring catering was ordered and delivered, tracking weather and flights, building trips, and more. While I was not necessarily around the aircraft, I gained a solid understanding of all the factors that contribute to safe and efficient operations and as a future corporate pilot, I will forever have an appreciation for the people behind desks arranging the details to get me airborne. This opportunity provided me the chance to get my feet wet in business aviation and also solidified my decision to focus my career on corporate aviation, which resulted in me pursuing an internship with a corporate flight department the following summer.
									<h4><h4>
									<img src="images/intern2.jpg" width="500" height="400" align="left"/><h4>
									<h4>I would have never imagined a year ago that I would have the experiences I had this past summer. I worked as a Pilot Intern for a Fortune 250 company from May to August and during this time, I was exposed to all the facets of a corporate flight department. I not only sat in the jump seat on trips in an aircraft very similar to <a href="https://www.globalair.com/aircraft-for-sale/ListingDetail/Challenger-350?AdId=93006">this one Global Air has for sale</a>, but I also got to witness maintenance inspections and spend time with the scheduler. In addition, I attended Upset Prevention and Recovery Training with Prevailance Aerospace, flew a Challenger 350 simulator at Flight Safety, and connected with a handful of pilots while on trips. These experiences were unmatched and because of it, I will be much more prepared to enter the industry once I graduate. Most importantly, I learned what it means to be apart of a strong company culture that embodies a family-like atmosphere and I gained lifelong mentors in the people I worked with.

									<h4>Since I am graduating this May and hopefully moving onto a flight instructor position, my summers spent as an intern have come to an end. However, I am a huge proponent for internships and helping my peers excel, so if I can offer any tips in obtaining an internship or answer any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.</h4>

  								<h1><strong>From Bedtime Stories to Commercial Pilot<strong></h1>
                  <h2 class="colorlib-heading">About Me  |  August 30, 2021</h2>

                  <img src="images/Alden.JPG" width="300" height="400" align="left" /><h4></h4><h4>Typically the first thing talked about when meeting someone new in aviation is "what got you into aviation?" Aviation is a unique field because everyone has a story behind who or what moment sparked their interest in it.<h4>
                  <h4>Like some aviators, the affinity for the skies runs in my family. My grandfather, Alden Kane, flew the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress in WWII and instilled a love for flying early on in my dad and his siblings. My bedtime stories as a child mostly consisted of me questioning my dad about his adventures flying with my grandfather, my grandmother, and my aunts and uncles in their family aircraft. Although those stories evidence my interest in aviation from an early age, I was not one of those kids that grew up knowing I wanted to be a pilot and unfortunately, my parents never dressed me as a pilot for Halloween (but that would have made for cool pictures today).<p>
                  <h4>So how does that bring me to where I am now? As a sophomore in high school, I was considering career options and I wanted to choose a field that was meaningful, impactful, and rewarding. At the same time, my aunt was re-entering the corporate aviation industry as a pilot after a hiatus. My aunt was all the motivation and encouragement I needed in my destined quest to become a professional pilot.<h4>
                  <h4>Shortly after the spark to become a pilot ignited, I took a discovery flight at Oakland County International Airport (PTK), which is close to my hometown of West Bloomfield, Michigan and I was hooked. From that day forward, I decided there was no other way I could fulfill my future than in aviation. I soloed at age 16 and got my private pilot license just a month into my senior year of high school before I was faced with the daunting decision of choosing a college.<h4>
                  <h4>I originally gravitated towards larger aviation universities for their stellar rankings and industry connections. However, close to the time when my decision needed to be made, I realized I may get lost in the numbers, afraid to find my voice and build meaningful relationships. I switched up my deposits in a matter of seconds and enrolled at Saint Louis University - Parks College, where I am currently entering my senior year. Fun fact: Parks College is America's first federally certified school of aviation and our flight school certificate reads No. 1. The 150 students and 20 flight instructors in the flight program embodies a family-like atmosphere, where I can recognize almost every student and I can easily approach any instructor to fly with me for an out-of-block flight.<h4>
                  <img src="images/Blog.jpg" width="500" height="700" align="right" /><h4></h4><h4>This past June, I received my commercial pilot certificate for single-engine aircraft and I am training for my multi-engine add-on now. I also had an amazing internship experience in corporate aviation in Cleveland that solidified my desire to want to fly for a Fortune 500 company in my future. Being a senior now feels quite bittersweet, but I am looking forward to seeing myself grow and gain new perspectives in my relationships with my peers, instructors, and mentors. It is so meaningful to me to be able to carry on the Kane legacy in the skies knowing that my grandfather is smiling from above.<h4>
                  <h4>I am excited to share my experiences through my weekly blog, so be on the lookout every Monday for a new post. A huge thank you to <a href="www.globalair.com">Global Air</a> for awarding me the Calvin L. Carrithers scholarship and for supporting my aviation journey. Whether you're looking for a single-engine, private jet, or helicopter - look no further than <a href="www.globalair.com">Global Air</a> for your aircraft purchase. </h4>

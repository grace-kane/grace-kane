									<h1><strong>Switching Seats<strong></h1>
									<h2 class="colorlib-heading">Corporate Aviation  |  November 21, 2021</h2>
									<h4></h4>
									<h4>I haven't found myself at the controls since my multi-engine check ride, so I don't have a flight to talk about this week. However, the past two weeks I have been diving into the Fundamentals of Instruction of my CFI training. I plan to start flying next week and it will definitely take a few flights to get comfortable flying from the right seat. As I began thinking into the first few years of my career, I made the realization that all the flying I do will be from here on out will be from the right seat until I become a captain.</h4>
									<img src="images/SLUArcher.jpg" width="500" height="400" align="right" title="Carmelo Tundo of Aero Experience captured this moment of my instructor and I taxiing at CPS last March during my commercial training"/><h4>
									<h4>Since I was able to experience numerous flights from the cockpit of a Challenger 350 this past summer, I have been eager to find an opportunity in the right seat of a jet that is certified for single-pilot operations. A few months ago, I had a chance to get inside and learn about the Cessna Citation CJ4+. I didn't fly in the aircraft, so I can't discuss how it flew, but I can say that the cockpit is extremely pilot-friendly, especially for single pilot operations. Although many Cessna aircraft are outfitted with Garmin avionics, the CJ4 line has the Collins Aerospace Pro Line 21. Jets equipped with Garmin avionics offers a seamless transition for pilots from flight training environments that utilize Garmin G1000 or similar equipment. However, with my experience in the Challenger 350, the Pro Line 21 is easy to adapt to and use and it provides a handful of crucial data in an easy to read and interpret format.</h4>

									<h4>In fact, <a href="https://www.globalair.com/aircraft-for-sale/ListingDetail/Citation-CJ4?AdId=123460">GlobalAir is currently selling the brand new 2021 CJ4 Gen 2 with 0 hours</a>, which is an update to the CJ4+. Not only does this aircraft have great ramp appeal, but the performance and passenger experience it offers are unmatched. Finding myself in the right seat of one of these or a similar aircraft early in my career would be a dream come true to me. For now though, I am keeping my eyes set on my current goal of obtaining my CFI certificate one lesson plan and flight at a time. I look forward to sharing my experience as I move into the right seat next week.</h4>


									<h1><strong>Two Engines!<strong></h1>
									<h2 class="colorlib-heading">Flight Training  |  November 15, 2021</h2>
									<h4></h4>
									<h4>This past week I took and passed my commercial multi-engine add-on rating check ride! Since I already have my commercial license, the oral portion solely dealt with multi-engine aircraft performance, aerodynamics, and systems. One thing that is stressed in multi-engine training is that multi-engine aircraft can be more dangerous than single-engine aircraft due to the adverse effects the inoperative engine can create in the event of an engine failure. When an engine fails or is simulated failed, it is crucial to always fly the aircraft first by maintaining directional control and pitching for Vyse. Then, you want to assess the performance and decide whether you are in a safe place to troubleshoot, secure, and airstart or secure the aircraft and land as soon as possible. The flight portion consisted of slow flight, stalls (power-on, power-off, accelerated), a Vmc demo, steep turns, too many engine failures to count including a single engine instrument approach, an emergency descent and a short field takeoff and landing. Some key points the examiner stressed and told me most people get into trouble with on multi-engine flight portion is not adjusting for Vyse on the Vmc demo recovery, getting into uncomfortable attitudes while pitching down during the emergency descent, and not completing enough GUMP checks. I had a great check ride experience and I am excited for all the opportunities this new rating will open up for me!</h4>
									<img src="images/multi2.jpg" width="500" height="400" align="left"/><h4>
									<h4>All in all, multi-engine training was some of the most fun and challenging flight training I have completed to date. It was really rewarding to move into a larger, faster, and more complex aircraft and successfully apply my knowledge to fly the aircraft. The growth I experienced in my piloting abilities felt exponential in such a short amount of time in the aircraft. Through all of my training, the biggest takeaways I had was the importance of completing engine failure flows in a quick and efficient manner as well as staying ahead of the aircraft. With a faster aircraft, I noticed it was crucial to be on proper airspeeds and  not neglect GUMP (Gas - on, Undercarriage - down and locked, Mixture - full rich, Propellers - 2500 or Full) checks at the appropriate times in the pattern. I now have the required license and ratings for an Airline Transport Pilot license (ATP), but at 260 hours I have a ways to go until 1000 hours when I am eligible to take the ATP check ride. Maybe in the meantime I can find myself in the right seat of a <a href="https://www.globalair.com/aircraft-for-sale/ListingDetail/King-Air-250?AdId=123373">King Air</a>, or similar aircraft, but if not my flight training does not end here as I am now pursuing my Certified Flight Instructor rating. I am looking forward to the next few months of immense growth for me where I am transitioning from being a student to now being a teacher. It will be interesting to develop processes and ways of my own to effectively communicate information to students in order to maximize their learning.</h4>
									<h1><strong>My Parks College Experience<strong></h1>
									<h2 class="colorlib-heading">Flight Training  |  November 1, 2021</h2>
									<h4></h4>
									<h4>When choosing to pursue a career as a pilot, there is a wide range of decisions to be made regarding flight training such as Part 61 or Part 141, degree or no degree, ATP Program or university program, etc. One common outcome with all these programs is that by the end of it you will have all your ratings required for a career as a professional pilot. In today's blog, I wish to discuss factors contributing to my decision to pursue an aviation degree at Saint Louis University as well as share the positive experience I have had thus far. </h4>

									<h4>I began my college search knowing I wanted to study aviation and that I wanted a traditional college experience. Therefore, my search consisted of four year universities. Like many of my classmates and peers, I found myself googling "collegiate aviation programs." I quickly gravitated to what I found to be a list of top ranking aviation colleges and set my mind on a very well-known, large aviation college. One benefit of any Part 141 university is the R-ATP, which enables graduates of such programs to obtain their Airline Transport License at 1000 hours and 21 years old versus 1500 hours and 23 years old. Despite applying to six other schools, I was certain that this top ranking university was the place for me. I put my deposit down and soon after I began realizing that in a program so large I might just be a number and I may struggle to build valuable relationships with my peers and instructors. After I was placed on a year and a half waitlist for a flight slot at that university, I was certain there was somewhere else I could be more successful at. I toured SLU and I was caught on the family-like atmosphere.</h4>
									<img src="images/Nov1.JPG" width="500" height="400" align="left"/><h4>
									<h4>At SLU, a program of 124 students, I easily found my voice and developed meaningful relationships with those around me my freshman year. The program feels like a family and more importantly it is a tight-knit system of support as I know every instructor and most all the students. I was able to fly my second week of classes freshman year and in my two and a half years in the program there have only been a few times when I wasn't allocated an aircraft due to an aircraft to student shortage. The program has enabled me to get all my ratings while taking the summers off for internships and still graduate in three years. The university offers numerous scholarships for aviation students and flight training and the resources within the program and university are plentiful. Our department chair is known to reply to any student's email in about five minutes, which is remarkable and shows the administration's commitment to assisting students achieve their goals. This can be seen in our 71% program graduation rate from the recent Best Value Schools Top Pilot Schools where SLU was ranked No. 10. I truly believe that SLU trains its students to not only be competent pilots, but also prepares us to be more than a pilot and make our mark on the world.</h4>

									<h4/>Some other great things about the program include the 15 drive from main campus to the flight line, the fleet of 2019 Piper Archers <a href="https://www.globalair.com/aircraft-for-sale/ListingDetail/Archer-III-PA-28-181?AdId=122991">similar to this one</a>, and the meticulously maintained aircraft. One piece of advice I can't stress enough regardless of where you go or what you do is the importance of being proactive to reach your goals. </h4>

									<h1><strong>Sustainability in Flight Training<strong></h1>
									<h2 class="colorlib-heading">Flight Training  |  October 25, 2021</h2>
									<h4></h4>
									<h4>Flight schools all across the country are pumping hundreds and thousands of gallons of Avgas into their training aircraft every week and facing hefty fuel bills as a result. As the aviation industry moves towards a more sustainable future through the pledge to achieve net zero CO2 emissions by 2050, some makers and innovators in the flight training environment have been active in this initiative. With Diamond Aircraft's recent eDA40 announcement, they will remain a leader in innovation and the production of environmentally responsible training aircraft. Set to be certified in 2023, the aircraft will not only be economically conscious for our environment, but it will also be cost effective as it is estimated to reduce operating costs nearly 40% compared to traditional piston aircraft. The DC Fast Charging System of the aircraft is said to turn a depleted aircraft battery to full in 20 minutes which is ideal for quick turnarounds flights in the training environment.</h4>

									<h4>General aviation can also be more economically friendly and cost effective through training aircraft such as the DA40, DA42 and the Piper DX. Diamond Aircraft was the first to introduce Diesel piston single and multi-engine aircraft. This enables their aircraft to burn 50% less fuel and have lower operating costs compared to Avgas. Moreover, the Piper DX equipped with a Continental CD-155 nearly doubles the range of the aircraft and cuts the gallon per hour in half. These aircraft make general aviation more available across the globe since many countries beyond the United States face either difficulty obtaining or affording AvGas . It is a no brainer for flight schools to invest in aircraft like this now as they would save operating costs in the long run and contribute towards a more sustainable future for aviation. As GlobalAir always has the latest and greatest aircraft on the market, <a href="https://www.globalair.com/aircraft-for-sale/ListingDetail/Diamond-DA40-NG?AdId=82122">they currently have a DA40 NG available</a>, which will help save costs in the future and contribute to a cleaner environment.</h4>
									<h1><strong>A Successful Industry Engagement Event<strong></h1>
									<h2 class="colorlib-heading">Professional Development  |  October 18, 2021</h2>
									<h4></h4>
									<h4>With the numerous airline pathway programs at Part 141 universities, it can be easy for one to quickly identify their future job. The number of students interested in corporate aviation like myself is very slim, but the demand for pilots, schedulers, and mechanics in the industry is present similar to the demand for airline professionals. Some may find the corporate pilot lifestyle is not for them, but I believe it is worth exposing students to it early on so they can identify if it is an option for their future.</h4>
									<img src="images/bizav.JPG" width="500" height="700" align="right"<h4>
									<h4>If it were not for a Girls in Aviation Day event hosted by Masco Corporation at DTW when I was a senior in high school, I am not sure I would have discovered corporate aviation and sought out internships in it. When I took over as Parks College Women in Aviation president last spring, I devised a range of events to engage members in the aviation industry beyond commercial aviation. This past Sunday, we hosted one of our first industry engagement events ever at a corporate flight department in the St. Louis area that operates a Phenom 300E, which is a larger option to <a href="https://www.globalair.com/aircraft-for-sale/ListingDetail/Phenom-100?AdId=123243">this low-time Phenom 100 that is on the market.</a> As the demand for business aviation increases, used business jets are difficult to come by and this is a rare find 2018 model.</h4>

									<h4>A vast majority of the thirty Parks College Women in Aviation members that attended this event had never sat in a private jet or seen the inside of the flight deck. Seeing their faces light up and their eyes wide when they stepped in the jet was so rewarding to me. They were also able to hear from and connect with the corporation's two pilots who both have a variety of background experience from airlines to Part 135. This event might have served to spark interest for some in business aviation, but my ultimate goal was to diversify the knowledge of my peers with regards to general aviation as well as introduce corporate flight department operations to many. If you are a student, I encourage you to attend events like this to learn more about various avenues in your respected field and also network as much as possible! And if you are an industry professional, please consider giving your time to mentor students and expose them to what you do. It means so much to us students and you could have an immense impact on the future of one or many of us.</h4>

									<h1><strong>Combating Imposter Syndrome in the Cockpit<strong></h1>
									<h2 class="colorlib-heading">Flight Training  |  October 11, 2021</h2>
									<h4></h4>
									<h4>Today's blog is aimed at both collegiate students and flight training students who may feel at times like they aren't good enough, that they don't have the skills or competence to successful perform during a flight, or that it is difficult to visualize themselves flying for an airline or getting a dream job one day. The feelings can be related to something known as imposter syndrome and this term comes from Pauline Clance, a psychologist, who studied the phenomenon and discovered 70% of people suffer from imposter syndrome. The self-doubt feelings encountered with imposter syndrome are heavily prevalent in high-achieving people, members of minority groups, and students.</h4>

									<h4>Flight training, let alone flight training at a Part 141 university, is both arduous and at times unforgiving. It is evident there are quite high standards we as students are held to in rigid and fast pace training program. Some students might wish to exceed the standards to the point they become unrealistic and other students may suffer from a lack of confidence. No matter where you may stand, it is important to know you are not alone and these are common feelings in student pilots which correlates to self-handicapping according to an Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University study called "What Type of Collegiate Pilot is Likely to Experience Imposter Syndrome?"</h4>

									<h4>In the desired path towards becoming professional pilots many of us share, the character required of a pilot seldom permits a weak appearance. The vast majority of us can agree that we don't openly choose to talk about insecurities and instead we allow ourselves to internalize them. If you find yourself fighting imposter syndrome, I encourage you to have the necessary conversations with your friends, family, flight instructor, or an individual you feel will support you. Without bringing these feelings to light, one is unable to grow their mindset and as a result they will reach difficulties in maximizing their performance.</h4>

									<h4>However, there are things you can do on your own to be proactive in countering imposter syndrome. The first step you can take is ensuring you are proficient in stick and rudder skills, procedures, checklists, airspace, and aircraft knowledge. We all have received the infamous "what's the difference between currency and proficiency" question on a check ride and we know the dangers of prolonged periods of not flying or not brushing up on ground knowledge. Another piece of advice is to reaffirm your abilities with positive statements such as being capable of passing. If you find yourself facing a setback or failure, understand that it is part of the process and these tribulations accompany great learning opportunities for the future. With every situation, there is always something positive, so focus on that and how you can better prepare yourself for the future. Lastly, understand what is factual such as passing the exam or possessing a certificate. The feelings you feel are not always true and may not be an accurate representation of yourself or your abilities.

							    <h4>Ultimately, these years are fundamental opportunities for learning and growth to mold us into successful and competent professional pilots. Determine what works best for you and do not be afraid to speak up if something doesn't feel right.</h4>

									<h4>This week, I want to highlight this beautiful aircraft <a href="https://www.globalair.com/aircraft-for-sale/ListingDetail/M-Class-M600?AdId=123156">Global Air has for sale - the Piper M600.</a> It would be a dream for me to find myself in the right seat of an aircraft of this kind. Maybe someday, but for now the Piper Seminole and Archer are where I will be.</h4>
									<h1><strong>An Eventful Seminole Flight<strong></h1>
									<h2 class="colorlib-heading">Flight Training  |  October 4, 2021</h2>
									<h4></h4>

									<h4>This past week, I ventured on my last cross country as a student at Parks College in the Piper Seminole to complete one of my last requirements prior to my multi-engine check ride. During my time as a student, some of the exciting places I have flown to include Madison, Nashville, the Ozarks, Memphis, and many other smaller cities surrounding St. Louis.</h4>

									<h4>One thing I didn't get to take advantage of due to the pandemic was the ability to take passengers on cross country flights. This flight was different for me because I was able to share general aviation with two of my friends who had little exposure to the field and collegiate flight training environment. To fulfill my course requirements, I had to fly a 2.0 day and 2.0 night cross country in the Piper Seminole with a majority of the time being under the hood. Unfortunately, it was a perfectly clear evening, so I had to put on the foggles instead of experiencing the excitement of shooting an approach close to minimums and logging actual time.</h4>
									<img src="images/IMG_0802.JPG" width="500" height="400" align="left"<h4>
									<h4>After noticing a broken fuel cap during preflight, we got on our way to the Kansas City Downtown Airport (MKC) from the St. Louis Downtown Airport (CPS) and flew direct before being vectored to the final approach course for the ILS Runway 19. On the ground, we enjoyed some of the best barbeque I have ever tasted before civil twilight began and I was able to log night hours. On the ground in Kansas City, my instructor and I noticed the aircraft was topped off by the FBO despite explicitly asking for a set number of gallons in each tank in order to meet takeoff weight. We sat on the ground for an extensive amount of time to burn off fuel in order to be within limits prior to takeoff. Despite some unexpected mishaps, it was a fun and memorable flight filled with much learning and the opportunity to refine my skills in the Seminole.</h4>

									<h4>It wouldn't be a multi-engine training flight without my instructor throwing an engine failure at me during the approach of both legs. Multi-engine training has been a fun challenge from quickly managing engine failures to learning more complex systems and the aerodynamics and characteristics associated with dual engines. The Piper Seminole is a great multi-engine trainer because it was designed for training with safety in mind. The late 1970s Seminole was well designed with a 56 KIAS VMC and 55 KIAS stall speed in landing configuration which is part of the reason it is a popular trainer among flight schools. The unfeathering accumulator allows for a failed engine to be airstarted by releasing oil pressure to the prop hub when the engine is unfeathered. Prior to Seminole's being made with unfeathering accumulators, the starter had to be engaged to get the propellor turning again after an in-flight failure.</h4>

									<h4>I would argue that there is one better trainer on the market for multi-engine training, especially for training students making the jump to airline and jet flying shortly. It is the DA42, <a href="https://www.globalair.com/aircraft-for-sale/ListingDetail/DA-42-VI?AdId=121880">which Global Air has on the market.</a> The single power lever control, FADEC, and feathering switch make the transition from DA42 to jet flying much easier. It is a long term cost effective option for a flight school because its Austro Engines burn fuel as if it were a single engine aircraft and they also take the cheaper alternative to 100LL - Jet A.</h4>
									<h1><strong>YES, You Can Do It!<strong></h1>
									<h2 class="colorlib-heading">Scholarships  |  September 27, 2021</h2>
									<h4></h4>

									<h4>When it comes to applying for scholarships, I have heard some of my peers  mention that scholarships are too competitive and that they have applied for a few, but never received any. I used to think the same thing early on in my flight training as I was antsy to be relieved of some of the private pilot license flight fees. However, instead I worked on building my experience and skillset so that I could someday be considered for scholarships.</h4>

									<h4>This is an ironic story, but one of the first scholarships I received in aviation was from the SoCal Pilots Association. I would have never thought to apply to this scholarship, but I had actually stumbled on a Global Air scholarship recipient's blog back in 2019 and she had just posted a list of scholarships to apply to. Now, here I am, writing to advise students of the numerous scholarships available to them and what they can do to help support the costs of an education in aviation.</h4>

									<h4>Since 2019 (my freshman year of college), I have submitted just over 100 scholarship applications and I am grateful to have received about 20 of them. They have not only been a huge assistance in my pursuit of a bachelors degree at Saint Louis University, but they have supported me financially in my flight training as well. Not only that, but the people and donors that I have connected with as a result of being a scholarship recipient have been so supportive and many of whom I keep in close contact with to this day.</h4>

									<h4>I think being persistent has helped me immensely in obtaining scholarships because I applied for the Global Air Scholarship three times and on the third time I was awarded the scholarship. If you don't get a scholarship, do not give up! Write it down and come back next year showing you have grown and gained new experiences. In addition, I applied for the Captain Jason Dahl Scholarship two times before receiving it. If you continually apply, the scholarship committee will likely recognize your name and application and take note of that.</h4>

									<h4>Some tips I have to share about applying to scholarships include:</h4>
									<li><h4>Join the professional organization offering the scholarship. Some scholarships that I know of like Women in Aviation and Women in Corporate Aviation require you be a member of their organization to apply for scholarships. If you think about it, the $30 membership will pay off if you take the chance and apply and only get one scholarships. Plus, you have access to so many benefits beyond scholarships such as mentorship and networking.</h4></li>
									<li><h4>It isn't always about which scholarship is the most money. Often times when there are organizations such as WAI that allow you to only pick 3 scholarships, people will gravitate to the 5,000-10,000 scholarships. However, because of that you will likely have a better chance applying for a lesser in value scholarship as it is not people's first choice.</h4></li>
									<li><h4>Follow all guidelines and make sure you check all the boxes for each requirement. Ask for letters of recommendations early as your recommenders will write higher quality letters when they know they are not in a time crunch. Check over all documents you submit for spelling errors.</h4></li>
									<li><h4>If you are on Facebook, join the group <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Aviation-Scholarships-1570860942960030/">Aviation Scholarships.</a> This page has been a great resource for me over the years and almost every aviation scholarship offered is posted here.</h4></li>
									<li><h4>Customize your essay or statement to echo what the scholarship committee is looking for. If it is in memory of someone, do research on what their impact to aviation was and relate that to what your future aspirations are.</h4></li>
									<li><h4>Be involved and help out in your community. People giving out scholarships are givers and want to see that you will do something to give back to your community. Find something in that area you are passionate about and do it.</h4></li>
									<li><h4>Lastly, ask for help! If you need someone to read over an essay, seek out someone who is willing to help. Don't be afraid to reach out to people. Believe in yourself and you will achieve outstanding things. If I can offer any support to you in your pursuit of a scholarship, please email me as I would be more than happy to help.</h4></li>

									<h4>I am heading on my commercial multi-engine cross country from CPS (St. Louis Downtown) to MKC (Kansas City Downtown) later this week in the Piper Seminole. Although my multi-engine training isn't conducted in an aircraft like <a href="https://www.globalair.com/aircraft-for-sale/ListingDetail/DA-62?AdId=123060">this Diamond DA62 that Global Air currently has for sale,</a> the Seminole is a great training aircraft and multi training has been a ton of fun. I am excited to share the details of this flight so check back in next Monday for that story!</h4>

									<h1><strong>Safety Culture in Collegiate Flight Training<strong></h1>
									<h2 class="colorlib-heading">Flight Training  |  September 20, 2021</h2>
									<h4></h4>

									<h4>I went through all of my private pilot training at a Part 61 school not knowing or being taught the importance of aviation safety. It wasn't that my training was conducted in an unsafe manner, but with operations out of one of the busiest general aviation airports in Michigan, there was bound to be hazards in our system which warranted mitigation. The depth of my safety mindset during my private training pertained to the infamous "IMSAFE" checklist and the airworthiness of the aircraft. Getting my private before entering a Part 141 collegiate aviation program had a major upside as it ultimately allowed me to graduate a year early, but I was also at a disadvantage because of the lack of a safety culture during the roots of my pilot training. When seeking out a Part 61 or 141 school to conduct your training at, I would highly advise asking whether the program has a Safety Management System (SMS), accident history, and what their safety culture is like. </h4>
									<img src="images/safety.jpg" width="400" height="600" align="right"<h4>
									<h4>I am grateful to have ended up at a university that is forward thinking in terms of safety and is working to develop a robust Safety Management System. Furthermore, it is even more beneficial to me to be involved in numerous decisions in terms of the safety of our flight training environment through my former role as ASAP leader and current role of PEDALS leader on the Parks College Aviation Safety Committee.</h4>

									<h4>For those of you that may not know what a Safety Management System is, it is a system designed to manage risk based on four pillars which include safety promotion, safety risk management, safety culture, and safety assurance. It is a requirement for all Part 121 commercial airlines to have a SMS and it will soon be a requirement for Part 135 charter operators. Although having a SMS isn't required for flight schools, I believe having a positive safety culture is crucial for students' futures and that begins with developing aspects of a SMS. </h4>

									<h4>The main aspect of our safety system at Parks College Center of Aviation Science is our PEDALS reporting system, which stands for Parks Event Debrief and Learning System. Students, instructors, dispatchers, and mechanics identify hazards in our training environment and as a committee we work together to mitigate the hazards in our system and inform the community of pertinent safety events. We also have a Flight Data Monitoring (FDM) system in our <a href="https://www.globalair.com/aircraft-for-sale/ListingDetail/Diamond-DA40-XLT?AdId=82887">Diamond 20</a>, <a href="https://www.globalair.com/aircraft-for-sale/ListingDetail/Archer-PA-28-180?AdId=93121">Piper Archer</a>, and Piper Seminole aircraft which has perimeters set and a flight is flagged and investigated when there are exceedances to the safe operating margins. It is important to mention these systems operate on the principle of just culture meaning that the organization understands that mistakes are apart of a system and therefore punitive actions against individuals are avoided. In addition, we send monthly safety newsletters and host semesterly safety standdowns. These events and systems help contribute to a positive safety culture in our community and also help students be better prepared to enter into an organization with robust safety programs. Safety in aviation is paramount and whether you are prospective flight student or current student, I would suggest asking questions to learn more about aviation safety. </h4>

									<h1><strong>Finding a Mentor<strong></h1>
									<h2 class="colorlib-heading">Networking  |  September 13, 2021</h2>

									<h4>It is never too early or too late in your career to find a mentor. Flight training is arduous and there are numerous highs and lows that accompany the journey of student to professional pilot. Mentors can serve a crucial role in encouragement, exposure, and advancement in one's future. I can attest that I would not be where I am if it weren't for my mentors offering constant support and pushing me towards my next goals.</h4>

									<h4>A mentorship can take the form of a formal or informal relationship. My aunt and cousin were my first mentors as I began my private pilot training. They provided me the resources to succeed and persevere when training became tedious and difficult. Furthermore, my older siblings served as an immense mentors for me. I witnessed them become leaders of their craft, giving back to others and impacting their communities in amazing ways and I was inspired to do the same. As a result of this mentorship from my family early on, I have high aspirations to serve as a mentor in my future for kids who don't come from an aviation family or may not have anyone to look to for support in their life. </h4>
									<img src="images/family.jpg" width="500" height="400" align="left"  title="My Aunt Adele, cousin Mikey, Andrew, and I celebrating my high school graduation"/><h4>
									<h4>When I arrived in St. Louis for my freshman year, I realized I was far from face-to-face family support and therefore, I sought a mentor in the area. I stumbled upon Women in Corporate Aviation, unbeknownst at the time that I was destined for a career in corporate aviation. I was paired with a mentor who flew a Gulfstream 500 and 600 in St. Louis similar to this aircraft currently on the market with <a href="https://www.globalair.com/aircraft-for-sale/ListingDetail/Gulfstream-G550?AdId=89878Global">Global Air.</a> At the time, I had only my private pilot license and my mentor  powered up the aircraft for me and spent an hour in the plane explaining the aircraft and its systems to me. Although our formal mentorship ended after a year, she continues to serve as a foundation of support and she has connected me to numerous individuals in the industry who I also often look to for encouragement. </h4>

									<h4>If you are lost on how to go about finding a mentor, I have some helpful tips that could lead to you gaining a lifelong mentor. </h4>
									<li><h4>Look into professional organization mentorship programs Some examples include Women in Corporate Aviation, Women in Aviation, National Business Aviation Association, Airline Pilots Association, etc. The National Business Aviation Association is assigning mentors to mentees from now until September 30th. You can make a profile and choose an industry professional to serve as your mentor. All of the listed mentors have a long list of impressive accomplishments and can be a great source of networking as well as learning leadership skills that you can transfer into your everyday life. Gain a mentor today at <a href="https://mentoring.nbaa.org/home">NBAA</a></h4></li>
									<li><h4>Connect with professionals on LinkedIn.I recently spoke to a friend wanting to greater expose himself to corporate aviation. He found pilots at Fortune 500 companies and connected with them on LinkedIn and sent a message to them requesting to form a mentorship. He has had numerous phone calls with some of them and has successfully gained mentors that way.</h4></li>
									<li><h4>A mentor doesn't have to be in the same career field as you. During my internship this past summer, I gained great perspectives from company employees who were engineers and business people. As a young professional, I believe these perspectives helped me develop and advance myself on another level. Mentorships both within your industry and outside of your industry help contribute to a well-rounded professional who is able to adapt to a range of environments and personalities.</h4></li>

									<h4>If you are just beginning your training or education and are looking for advice from someone who recently went through those stages, I have extensive knowledge I can share with you. Please don't hesitate to reach out for support. Aviation is a tight-knit community and I have never met anyone who wasn't willing to help me advance myself in the industry, so I am happy to do my part in giving back to this amazing community.</h4>

									<h4>This weeks post is in remembrance of my cousin and mentor, Andrew St. Denis. Andrew was 26 and passed away a few days ago in a car accident. He was just nearing his check ride to become an Airline Transport Pilot for Republic Airways and he had a successful career ahead of him in commercial aviation. Throughout my flight training and life he served as a huge mentor to me and he was a pilot I aspired to mimic in my future. It was his mom, a medevac pilot, who gave me the motivation to enter aviation and Andrew helped propel me even further in it. I know he will always be there with me when I take to the skies. The future of aviation lost one of its best, but I know Andrew's legacy in the skies will be well carried by all those who he touched. Fly high, Andrew, and blue skies and tailwinds up there. </h4>

									<h1><strong>Industry Experiences Early On<strong></h1>

									<h4>Whether you're a student or industry professional, the value of internships on one's future can not be understated. For the industry professionals, if you don't already have an internship program established, I highly recommend bringing the idea to fruition. For the students, you will not regret obtaining an internship for a summer or semester during your college years. I always tell my peers that flight training and classes can be done at any time, but the opportunity to get real industry experience and work alongside distinguished professionals early on in your career journey is rare.</h4>

									<h4>Following my freshman year at SLU, I caught a glimpse of Part 135 and 91 operations through an internship with Pentastar Aviation in Waterford, Michigan. Although it was not a typical internship experience due to COVID, it was so valuable to gain hands-on experience in the Operations Control Center at Pentastar while most of the country worked from home. As a Flight Follower Intern, I was tasked with the behind the scenes jobs such as ensuring catering was ordered and delivered, tracking weather and flights, building trips, and more. While I was not necessarily around the aircraft, I gained a solid understanding of all the factors that contribute to safe and efficient operations and as a future corporate pilot, I will forever have an appreciation for the people behind desks arranging the details to get me airborne. This opportunity provided me the chance to get my feet wet in business aviation and also solidified my decision to focus my career on corporate aviation, which resulted in me pursuing an internship with a corporate flight department the following summer.
									<h4><h4>

									<h4>I would have never imagined a year ago that I would have the experiences I had this past summer. I worked as a Pilot Intern for a Fortune 250 company from May to August and during this time, I was exposed to all the facets of a corporate flight department. I not only sat in the jump seat on trips in an aircraft very similar to <a href="https://www.globalair.com/aircraft-for-sale/ListingDetail/Challenger-350?AdId=93006">this one Global Air has for sale</a>, but I also got to witness maintenance inspections and spend time with the scheduler. In addition, I attended Upset Prevention and Recovery Training with Prevailance Aerospace, flew a Challenger 350 simulator at Flight Safety, and connected with a handful of pilots while on trips. These experiences were unmatched and because of it, I will be much more prepared to enter the industry once I graduate. Most importantly, I learned what it means to be apart of a strong company culture that embodies a family-like atmosphere and I gained lifelong mentors in the people I worked with.

									<h4>Since I am graduating this May and hopefully moving onto a flight instructor position, my summers spent as an intern have come to an end. However, I am a huge proponent for internships and helping my peers excel, so if I can offer any tips in obtaining an internship or answer any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.</h4>

  								<h1><strong>From Bedtime Stories to Commercial Pilot<strong></h1>
                  <h2 class="colorlib-heading">About Me  |  August 30, 2021</h2>

                  <img src="images/Alden.JPG" width="300" height="400" align="left" /><h4></h4><h4>Typically the first thing talked about when meeting someone new in aviation is "what got you into aviation?" Aviation is a unique field because everyone has a story behind who or what moment sparked their interest in it.<h4>
                  <h4>Like some aviators, the affinity for the skies runs in my family. My grandfather, Alden Kane, flew the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress in WWII and instilled a love for flying early on in my dad and his siblings. My bedtime stories as a child mostly consisted of me questioning my dad about his adventures flying with my grandfather, my grandmother, and my aunts and uncles in their family aircraft. Although those stories evidence my interest in aviation from an early age, I was not one of those kids that grew up knowing I wanted to be a pilot and unfortunately, my parents never dressed me as a pilot for Halloween (but that would have made for cool pictures today).<p>
                  <h4>So how does that bring me to where I am now? As a sophomore in high school, I was considering career options and I wanted to choose a field that was meaningful, impactful, and rewarding. At the same time, my aunt was re-entering the corporate aviation industry as a pilot after a hiatus. My aunt was all the motivation and encouragement I needed in my destined quest to become a professional pilot.<h4>
                  <h4>Shortly after the spark to become a pilot ignited, I took a discovery flight at Oakland County International Airport (PTK), which is close to my hometown of West Bloomfield, Michigan and I was hooked. From that day forward, I decided there was no other way I could fulfill my future than in aviation. I soloed at age 16 and got my private pilot license just a month into my senior year of high school before I was faced with the daunting decision of choosing a college.<h4>
                  <h4>I originally gravitated towards larger aviation universities for their stellar rankings and industry connections. However, close to the time when my decision needed to be made, I realized I may get lost in the numbers, afraid to find my voice and build meaningful relationships. I switched up my deposits in a matter of seconds and enrolled at Saint Louis University - Parks College, where I am currently entering my senior year. Fun fact: Parks College is America's first federally certified school of aviation and our flight school certificate reads No. 1. The 150 students and 20 flight instructors in the flight program embodies a family-like atmosphere, where I can recognize almost every student and I can easily approach any instructor to fly with me for an out-of-block flight.<h4>
                  <img src="images/Blog.jpg" width="400" height="600" align="right" /><h4></h4><h4>This past June, I received my commercial pilot certificate for single-engine aircraft and I am training for my multi-engine add-on now. I also had an amazing internship experience in corporate aviation in Cleveland that solidified my desire to want to fly for a Fortune 500 company in my future. Being a senior now feels quite bittersweet, but I am looking forward to seeing myself grow and gain new perspectives in my relationships with my peers, instructors, and mentors. It is so meaningful to me to be able to carry on the Kane legacy in the skies knowing that my grandfather is smiling from above.<h4>
                  <h4>I am excited to share my experiences through my weekly blog, so be on the lookout every Monday for a new post. A huge thank you to <a href="www.globalair.com">Global Air</a> for awarding me the Calvin L. Carrithers scholarship and for supporting my aviation journey.

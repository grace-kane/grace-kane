                  <h3>By: Grace Kane</h3>
                  <img src="images/Alden.JPG" width="300" height="400" align="left" /><h4></h4><h4>Typically the first thing talked about when meeting someone new in aviation is "what got you into aviation?" Aviation is a unique field because everyone has a story behind who or what moment sparked their interest in it.<h4>
                  <h4>Like some aviators, the affinity for the skies runs in my family. My grandfather, Alden Kane, flew the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress in WWII and instilled a love for flying early on in my dad and his siblings. My bedtime stories as a child mostly consisted of me questioning my dad about his adventures flying with my grandfather, my grandmother, and my aunts and uncles in their family aircraft. Although those stories evidence my interest in aviation from an early age, I was not one of those kids that grew up knowing I wanted to be a pilot and unfortunately, my parents never dressed me as a pilot for Halloween (but that would have made for cool pictures today).<p>
                  <h4>So how does that bring me to where I am now? As a sophomore in high school, I was considering career options and I wanted to choose a field that was meaningful, impactful, and rewarding. At the same time, my aunt was re-entering the corporate aviation industry as a pilot after a hiatus. My aunt was all the motivation and encouragement I needed in my destined quest to become a professional pilot.<h4>
                  <h4>Shortly after the spark to become a pilot ignited, I took a discovery flight at Oakland County International Airport (PTK), which is close to my hometown of West Bloomfield, Michigan and I was hooked. From that day forward, I decided there was no other way I could fulfill my future than in aviation. I soloed at age 16 and got my private pilot license just a month into my senior year of high school before I was faced with the daunting decision of choosing a college.<h4>
                  <h4>I originally gravitated towards larger aviation universities for their stellar rankings and industry connections. However, close to the time when my decision needed to be made, I realized I may get lost in the numbers, afraid to find my voice and build meaningful relationships. I switched up my deposits in a matter of seconds and enrolled at Saint Louis University - Parks College, where I am currently entering my senior year. Fun fact: Parks College is America's first federally certified school of aviation and our flight school certificate reads No. 1. The 150 students and 20 flight instructors in the flight program embodies a family-like atmosphere, where I can recognize almost every student and I can easily approach any instructor to fly with me for an out-of-block flight.<h4>
                  <img src="images/Blog.jpg" width="400" height="600" align="right" /><h4></h4><h4>This past June, I received my commercial pilot certificate for single-engine aircraft and I am training for my multi-engine add-on now. I also had an amazing internship experience in corporate aviation in Cleveland that solidified my desire to want to fly for a Fortune 500 company in my future. Being a senior now feels quite bittersweet, but I am looking forward to seeing myself grow and gain new perspectives in my relationships with my peers, instructors, and mentors. It is so meaningful to me to be able to carry on the Kane legacy in the skies knowing that my grandfather is smiling from above.<h4>
                  <h4>I am excited to share my experiences through my weekly blog, so be on the lookout every Monday for a new post. A huge thank you to <a href="www.globalair.com">Global Air</a> for awarding me the Calvin L. Carrithers scholarship and for supporting my aviation journey. Whether you're looking for a single-engine, private jet, or helicopter - look no further than <a href="www.globalair.com">Global Air</a> for your aircraft purchase. </h4>
